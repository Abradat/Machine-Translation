THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC
A film by Carl Th. Dreyer
At the Bibliotheque de la Chambre des Deputes in Paris resides one of the most extraordinary documents in the history of the world:
The record of the trial of Joan of Arc, the trial that ended in her death.
The questions of the judges and Joan's responses were recorded exactly.
Reading it, we discover the real Joan, not in armor, but simple and human... a young woman who died for her country.
And we are witness to an amazing drama:
A young, pious woman, confronted by a group of orthodox theologians and powerful judges.
I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth... nothing but the truth...
In France I'm called Joan... in my village, I'm called Jeannette.
How old are you?
Nineteen...
I think.
Do you know the Lord's Prayer?
Who taught it to you?
My mother.
Will you recite it?
You claim to be sent by God?
To save France... it's why I was born.
So you think God hates the English?
I don't know if God loves or hates the English... but I do know that the English will all be chased from France... except those that die here!
You have said that St. Michael appeared to you... in what form?
Did he have wings?
Did he wear a crown?
How was he dressed?
How did you know if it was a man or a woman?
Was he naked?
Do you think God was unable to clothe him?
Did he have long hair?
Why would he have cut it?
Why do you wear men's clothing?
If we give you women's clothing, would you wear it?
When the mission that God has entrusted to me is over, I will again dress as a woman.
So it is God who orders you to dress as a man?
And what reward do you expect from Our Lord?
The salvation of my soul.
You blaspheme God.
This is disgraceful.
For me, she is a saint.
Has God made you promises?
That has nothing to do with your trial.
Shouldn't we let the judges decide that?
Shall we put this question to a vote?
So!
What has God promised you?
Perhaps that you will be delivered from prison?
When?
I know neither the day... nor the hour.
Since she couldn't be made to confess easily, we will have to be clever.
Go find a letter bearing the signature of King Charles.
Write the letter that I will dictate.
I have great pity for you!
Do you know the signature of your King?
I have a letter from him to you.
I can't read.
To our beloved Joan...
I am preparing to march on Rouen with a mighty army.
I send you this devoted priest, have confidence in him.
Just as Jesus is the son of God, you claim to be the daughter of God?
Will you now recite the Lord's Prayer?
God has told you that you shall be delivered from prison?
By a great victory!
God has promised you that you will go to Heaven?
So you are certain of being saved?
Be careful, it's a dangerous answer.
Since you are sure of your salvation, then you have no need of the Church?
Are you in a state of grace?
Well! Respond!
Are you in a state of grace?
If I am, may God keep me there.
If I am not, may God grant it to me!
Father... permit me to attend Mass.
Joan, if we permit you to attend Mass... will you stop wearing men's clothes?
So, you would rather dress as a man than attend Mass?
These shameless clothes... abominable to God...
You are no daughter of God.
You are Satan's creature!
Go prepare the torture chamber.
She really looks like a daughter of God.
In the torture chamber.
Look at your judges.
Don`t you feel that these learned doctors are wiser than you?
But God is even wiser!
Listen, Joan, we know that your visions do not come from God... but from the devil.
How do you know a good angel from an evil angel?
You have knelt before Satan, not St. Michael!
Don't you see that it's the Devil who has turned your head... who has tricked you... and betrayed you?
I think she's ready to abjure!
The Church opens its arms to you.
If you reject it, the Church will abandon you and you will be alone... alone!
Yes, alone... alone with God!
Even if you part my soul from my body I will revoke nothing... and if I say something, later I will say it was forced from me!
Not for anything in the world do I want her to die a natural death.
She is very weak.
She has a fever... we must bleed her.
Be careful, she could end her own life...
she's very crafty.
Bring the Sacraments.
Is there something you wish to tell us?
I fear to be in great danger of death... and if I die, I ask you to bury my body in sacred ground.
The Church is merciful... it always welcomes the misguided lamb.
Joan, we all want what's best for you.
Look, I have sent for the Sacraments.
I am a good Christian.
Don`t you know it is the Body of the Lord that you refuse?
Do you not see that you outrage God by your obstinacy?
I love and honor God... with all my heart.
You claim... that I am... sent by the devil.
It's not true... to make me suffer, the devil has sent you... and you... and you... and you...
There is nothing left to be done...
alert the torturer!
Let us try one last time to save this lost soul...
It is to you, Joan, that I speak.
It is to you that I say that your King is a heretic!
My King is the most noble Christian of all Christians.
The arrogance of this woman is insane.
France has never seen such a monster.
I have never wronged anyone.
If you do not sign, you will be burned alive...
See the torturer who awaits.
You don't have the right to die.
Your King still needs you.
Joan, sign... and save your life!
Joan, we have great pity for you.
Sign, Joan!
In the name of the Lord.
Amen.
Since you recognized your errors, we exonerate you from the bonds of excommunication.
But because you have greatly sinned, we condemn you... to perpetual imprisonment with the bread of sorrow and the water of anguish.
You made a good day's work:
you have saved your life and your soul.
She has only made fools of you!
Long live Joan!
Go find the judges!
I take it back, I have lied...
Hurry!
I have committed a great sin...
I have denied God... to save my life.
But, Joan, before the people you have confessed that you were inspired by the devil.
You still believe you were elect by the Lord?
That answer is equivalent to death.
I acknowledged from fear of the fire.
Have you anything else to tell us?
We have come to prepare you for death.
Now... already?
Which death?
At the stake.
I'll bring the last Sacrament.
Tell me, how can you still believe that you are sent by God?
His ways are not our ways.
Yes, I am His child.
And the great victory?
My martyrdom!
And your deliverance?
Death!
Will you take confession?
May the Body of Our Lord Jesus Christ keep thy soul... in everlasting life.
Be courageous, Joan.
Your last hour is close.
Dear sweet God, I accept death with a good heart... but do not let me suffer too long.
Will I be with You tonight in Paradise?
Jesus!
You have burned a saint!
The flames sheltered Joan's soul as it rose to heaven.
Joan whose heart has become the heart of France...
Joan whose memory will always be honoured by the people of France.
BANNEC. On an island where winter storms wipe out all forms of life... four men come in two teams to spend the summer collecting seaweed in total isolation
"There should be one or two bottles left in my trunk. If you want to share a toast..."
"You broke my last bottle of plonk! Give me my knife back, at least!"
There is no source at Bannec. The only cistern, which collects rain water... is a constant worry for the four solitary men.
At daybreak, when the tide is low, Ambroise starts his gathering... at one of those thousands of reefs that make the sea so dangerous here
This morning, Ambroise's arm feels weak and has none of the usual skill.
Jean-Marie, on the other hand, is already back with a huge crop.
The seaweed should be spread and partly dried in the sun before being burned.
The harvest season only lasts 3 months. Ambroise's companion is worried...
The drought goes on and the water cistern sinks to an alarming level.
With the evening comes some rest.
"Are you mad?
You use drinking water to wash your hands ?
... You think you can get away with such girlish behavior here ?"
As you let me down and went to work for Jean-Marie, he'll have to feed you!
Feverish and helpless, Ambroise considers going back to his home at Ouessant... where there is a doctor.
Ambroise gathers all his force to raise the sail with his only working arm... But the dead calm makes the trip impossible without rowing.
Ouessant, which is separated from Bannec by the difficult Fromveur passage... is the biggest and mildest of the islands of the archipelago.
Jean-Marie's mother would never have dared to put on her headdress again... if she had missed the daily mass
but she was on very bad terms with her neighbor, Ambroise's mother.
Malgorn, one of the guardians of the Menn-Tenn-Sell lighthouse... finally has his turn of ten days to spend on land
"Something's strange on Bannec... Today none of the boats parted."
The devoted doctor Lesenn is the youngest islanders' best friend, despite his 67 years.
The locals all have a deep affection for him, based on respect and gratitude.
The guardian of Stiff, the lighthouse north-east of the island, agrees :
"There is surely something strange going on on Bannec..."
Faced with the Register of Sailors, this people consisting of widows, orphans, parents who lost their sons, is swift at reacting.
Mothers, daughters, seamen's wives, the Ouessant women are fearsome.... They try to perceive Bannec
"Doctor Lesenn ! Only he can do it..."
"Yes, it's disquieting... When the tide allows, I'll try to get to Bannec."
"Ambroise ! I found my knife ! Ambroise, we were wrong...
"Pierre, we can't just sit here and watch him suffer like this... We must get him to Ouessant..."
"Not saying against.. But how to traverse the Fromveur in this dead calm... With 4 men rowing we won't manage to go up the stream..."
Come on children, we need yet another sailor to get to Bannec...
Not a soldier, but a real sailor ! ..."
The fog, most dangerous of enemies...
The semaphore flag signals VARIABLE wind.
At daybreak.
But on the other side of the island, an old man is sick... and calling for help from the good doctor.
The end.
How's that?
Gotta hand it to you, Rico. The old bean's working all the time.
- What'll it be, gents?
- Spaghetti and coffee for two.
All right, sir.
Diamond Pete Montana.
He don't have to waste his time on cheap gas stations.
He's somebody.
He's in the big town doing things in a big way.
And look at us. Just a couple of nobodies, nothing.
Is that what you want, Rico?
A party like that for you?
"Caesar Enrico Bandello.
Honored by his friends."
I could do all the things that fella does and more.
Only I never got my chance. And what's there to be afraid of?
When I get in a tight spot, I shoot my way out of it. Why, sure.
Shoot first and argue afterwards.
You know, this game ain't for guys that's soft.
Yeah, there's money in the big town, all right.
And the women.
Good times, something doing all the time.
Exciting things, you know.
The clothes I could wear.
And then I'd quit, Rico.
I'd go back to dancing, like I used to before I met you.
I don't know.
I ain't made for this sort of thing.
Dancing.
That's what I wanna do.
Dancing?
Women?
And where do they get you?
I don't want no dancing.
I'm figuring on making other people dance.
- Oh, I ain't forgetting about the money.
- Money's okay, but it ain't everything.
Be somebody.
Look hard at a bunch of guys and know they'll do anything you tell them.
Have your own way or nothing. Be somebody.
- You'll get there, Rico. - Yeah.
- You'll show them.
- You know this was our last stand in this burg. We're pulling out.
- Where are we going?
- East.
Where things break big. So I beat it east, like I told you.
That's all there is to it.
I wanna run with your mob, if you'll let me. What do you say?
You won't be sorry for letting me in. I'll do anything you say.
I ain't afraid of nothing.
You think you're a hard guy?
There's nothing soft about me. Nothing yellow. I don't quit.
- You got an idea you're good, huh?
- Give me a chance to show you.
- What do you know about me?
- Oh, I heard plenty.
How you run things this end of town.
About this here Club Palermo, how it's your front.
I got told enough.
- I guess you're good with a rod too, huh?
- Quick with it and sure.
Well, that don't go around here. That's old stuff. This ain't the sticks.
Yeah, I get you.
All right.
You stick around.
But, remember, I'm the boss. And I give all the orders.
And when we split, we split my way.
- And no squawks. You get me?
- Yeah, sure, Mr. Vettori.
- All right, come on in, meet the boys.
Oh, they're 100 percent, all right. Every one of them.
There's Tony Passa.
Can drive a car better than any mug in the town.
Otero.
He's little, but he's the goods all right.
Bat Carilla.
Killer Peppi.
Kid Bean.
And this one here, Scabby. What a smart guy he is.
Boys.
Come on, Tony.
Wake up.
I want you to meet a new guy what's gonna be with us.
This is...
Caesar Enrico Bandello.
Oh, Little Caesar, huh?
Yeah, sure.
Olga brought him around a few days ago.
Not bad.
- All right. - I'll say he is.
Well, I got hold of a real dancer for a partner, didn't I, Mr. DeVoss?
He's an elegant dancer. We'll panic them after a few rehearsals.
Say, you're not trying to sell him to me, are you, Olga?
Well, young fella, I guess 100 a week ought to buy you.
That's more than I generally start with.
That's swell with me, even though it don't buy no limousines.
Gee, thanks, Mr. DeVoss. You'll never be sorry for this.
Come, Joey.
So it's you and me from now on.
Well, I'm glad.
And I'm not ashamed to tell you.
I guess you know by this time how I feel about you.
That's all right with you, isn't it?
Or have you got another girl?
A steady, I mean.
Hundreds of them, sure.
Only...
Only, what's the difference?
This is gonna be real.
- We'll make it mean something. - Yeah, Joey, let's.
Because I need somebody. Somebody like you.
Awful bad.
- You believe me, Olga?
- I want to believe you.
What's that?
What you got there, Joe?
What are you doing with that?
Can't you forget you've seen it?
It won't make no difference. Not between us, Olga.
Don't worry, baby.
It's just a little good-luck charm I carry around with me.
Is that your racket?
Maybe.
I suppose I got no right to ask you, Joe.
But now...
Now that we got an understanding.
Couldn't you leave it?
No.
I suppose I haven't got the right.
What would be the good of you asking, kid?
Once in a gang...
- You know the rest. - I don't want to know.
Only maybe...
Maybe it could be different this time.
If we try.
I've never seen the guy that could get away with it yet.
Black.
Seven. Sam Vettori is still waiting for you in your office.
All right, I guess I'll have to see him.
I wonder what he wants here.
Hey, Ritz.
You'd better stick with me. I'll need you in there.
- That Sam Vettori's a no-good lug. - You said it, boss.
Better let me go first. Cut that.
Hello, Arnie.
Surprised to see me in your swell joint?
Maybe I won't be after you tell me what you want here.
Oh, I'll tell you, all right.
Diamond Pete asked me to come up. He's coming up too.
- Pete Montana?
- That's who.
Well, if Pete wants you here, it's got to be all right with me.
- Hello, Mr. Montana. - Hello.
Hello.
- Hello, Arnie.
- Hello, how are you?
- Hello, Vettori. - Hello, boss.
Cigar?
Thanks.
Thanks, Arnie.
Sit down, boys. I got something to tell you.
A message from the Big Boy.
Now, listen.
Here's the lowdown.
- The Big Boy says... - Just a minute, boss.
Hey, you.
Nobody asked you to be butting in here, did they?
- Screw, mug. - You ain't giving me orders.
- You're a fresh guy, huh?
- Take it easy, Rico.
You go out there and wait for me.
Jake with me, boss.
Now, listen, boys.
Watch this guy McClure what's head of the new crime commission.
He's putting the screws on, and make no mistake about him.
Now, the Big Boy wants me to tell you guys to put the chains on your gorillas for the next few months.
Because if any of them go too far, it'll be just too bad. I've never seen nobody the Big Boy couldn't get to.
He can fix anything. That's why he's the Big Boy.
This bird McClure will be pie for him.
- He'll twist him around his little finger. - Don't kid yourself.
Nobody's squaring nothing with McClure. Not even the Big Boy.
Small jobs, that's different.
We could spring guys for them. But shooting?
No, sir.
It's guys like this torpedo of yours that cause all the trouble.
Who, Rico?
He's all right.
He's a little quick on the trigger, but that's because he's new.
Yeah?
Well, it's us that'll swing for him if he shoots at the wrong time.
Now, remember what I told you. Come on.
So long.
And you.
You take it easy with that cannon of yours.
Did you hear me?
Yes, Mr. Montana.
- Good night. - Good night.
- Good night. - Good night.
Do yourself a favor, will you, Rico?
Leave your gat home on the piano the next job you pull.
Yeah, park it next to your milk bottle.
Hey. Run your own mob, Arnie. I'll take care of mine.
Yeah, I'll park it.
I don't need no cannon to take care of guys like you, Mr. Lorch.
Yeah, we gotta be careful.
Little Arnie's interested in this here nightclub.
- If it ever gets out who pulled the job... - They'll never get wise to us.
They're careless, but they've never been tapped.
Yeah, but I don't like the whole business.
Neither do I, Sam.
Honest, I don't.
I couldn't sleep last night. I was up worried.
I don't want to take any chances. Not now the way they're closing down on us.
What's the matter, Tony, getting yellow?
No, but, geez, none of us wanna hang, do we?
You'd like to quit, wouldn't you?
You'd like to run out on us.
- You're yellow, you dirty... - Wait a minute, Rico.
Where do you get that yellow stuff?
You want to know who's yellow, I'll tell you.
Joe Massara, your pal.
- That's why he didn't show tonight. - He'll be here. Just because...
I know all about that stuff.
I'm gonna give him 10 minutes more.
Then we'll see.
Now, listen, Sam, Joe's all right. He's the best front man in the world.
Why, he can go to a swell hotel and order a suite, a suite, and it's all right.
Without Joe, we can't pull the job, and you know it.
What's that paper?
It's this layout I've been figuring out with Scabby.
- What, this nightclub job?
- Yeah.
Well, let me see it.
And until I say different nobody's gonna plan for this mob but me.
You get me?
He'll learn.
Now, come here, you guys.
Now, get this.
Hello, Joe.
Hello, Rico.
Come here.
I told you to be here at 8:30.
Oh, well, you see, I...
I was busy. I was rehearsing, and...
- Oh, you know how it is. - Yeah, I know how it is.
They've been saying it, only I didn't believe them.
They're crazy when they call you yellow.
Tell them they can go to...
Say, what's the big idea of the rush anyway?
It's a little job we need you for.
A little job at the Bronze Peacock.
What do you mean?
Are you trying to kid me or something?
How can I take the chance? They're all my friends, they all know me.
That's why, they'll never suspect you.
Now, don't stall, Joe.
I ain't stalling.
You gotta get me out of this, Rico. You gotta.
I don't want to...
Well, don't you see, I'm working steady now, and...
- Can't a guy ever say he's through?
- You're gonna be in on this, and you'll like it.
The time is to be sharp midnight on New Year's Eve.
I won't.
I can't.
I can't, don't you see?
I...
Well, gee, I...
- I'll be working New Year's Eve. - Now, listen, Joe.
This is the joint where you're working.
And don't you be forgetting it, either.
Come on in.
Well, maybe it ain't so hot.
- Maybe we can't buck Little Arnie. - I can.
You're too good, that's what.
Hello, Joe.
You were in a big hurry about getting here, weren't you?
- Maybe this kind of work ain't to your liking. - Joe's all right.
He's in with us.
Yeah, I'm in with you.
Well, let's see, now. Here's the way I dope this thing out.
I, Sam Vettori, not you, Rico, or nobody else.
- That's plain, ain't it?
- Sure.
Only, who stands here?
You kind of forgot that, didn't you?
Hey, I'm boss on this job, not you.
Smart guy, Rico. He's got plenty of brains.
I tell you, I'm afraid, Otero.
I'm afraid.
You're crazy.
Rico's coming with us.
Come on now, buck up.
And you, Joe.
You'll be in the lobby and give us the high sign if everything's on the up and up.
You get me?
Yeah, and if we get in a jam, you'll have to take a chance with the rest of us. Hey, quiet, quiet.
Holy Moses, it's Alvin McClure.
The crime commission buzzard.
Hey, DeVoss.
Come here.
What is it, Arnie?
What is it?
Bring McClure over here, I want to buy him a lemonade.
- Not tonight, some other time.
- Go on. Do as you're told.
Go on, De Voss, bring him here.
As you wish.
- Good evening, Mr. McClure. - Good evening, DeVoss.
- Quite a party.
- Thank you.
Delighted to have you with us, folks.
Mr. McClure, a Mr. Lorch, a financial backer of mine would like to meet you.
- May I bring him over to your table?
- Lorch?
Lorch?
- You mean the man they call Little Arnie?
- Yes, but...
- You say he's a financial backer of yours?
- Yes, but...
I didn't understand that a man of his type was connected with this place.
I'm sorry, DeVoss, but you might inform Mr. Lorch that we're leaving.
I came to this place under a misapprehension.
- Now, Mr. McClure...
- I'm sorry, folks but we'll have to go somewhere else.
You like my hair this way, Joey?
Sure.
I used to wear it... Where are you going?
- Just to get a package of cigarettes.
- Hurry back, darling, it's almost 12:00 and I wanna be with you for New Year's.
I'll be back in a minute. - What can I get you? - A Victor Noble.
Stay where you are. Oh, help!
Oh, God!
Open her up, Tony, this ain't no picnic.
What's the matter, Tony, losing your nerve?
Come on, let's go.
Let's go, we gotta get out of here. Come on.
Happy New Year.
Why, Joe...
Joey.
What is it?
What's the matter?
Nothing.
It's all right.
- The joint's been held up, that's all. - Held up?
They...
- They shot McClure. - Joe.
- Now you know. - It was you.
- No. No, it's a lie!
I... - You shot McClure.
No, I didn't, I swear.
It wasn't me that shot him. It was...
I don't know who.
But it's our hips for this job, all right.
Maybe...
Maybe everything will be all right, Joey.
Maybe he wasn't hurt badly.
But you're through with that bunch. You don't belong, Joe.
You're not that kind.
You'll never go near them again.
Olga you can't go back on a gang.
Well, everything come off all right?
Tell me.
Everything was all right. Only I had to take care of a guy.
- Who was it?
- McClure.
McClure.
You shot McClure.
A million guys in this town, and you had to pick the crime commissioner.
What did I tell you, Rico?
Didn't I say to make it clean?
Didn't I say no gunplay?
Think I'm going to let a guy pull a gat on me?
Any more of these cracks, and this is my last job.
The head of the crime commission.
The Big Boy can't do us no good this trip.
They'll get us dead sure now.
- What am I gonna do?
- Why don't you go and give yourself up?
You're slipping, Sam.
And Tony, what about him?
Where is he?
Getting rid of the car. Tony got nervous.
You and that rod of yours. Flaherty's downstairs, a couple of dicks with him.
They're coming right up.
Stay where you are, all of you.
They won't know nothing unless they picked Tony up. Give them the shaft.
I'll be in here listening.
Happy New Year, boys.
Say, there's a lonesome touring car down the street.
I was wondering if you happened to know anything about it.
How should I know anything about it?
- Ain't it got license plates on it?
- Yes, but they're phony.
It was stolen on the north side tonight.
Oh, I got a good café business.
I don't know nothing about automobiles what's been stolen.
Well, you might if some of the bright young men around here had anything to do with it, wouldn't you?
- Wasn't there anybody in it?
- Yes, one guy.
But not when we got there. He beat it.
But we got a good description of him, though.
I'm telling you, I don't know nothing about it.
Well, come on, fellas.
As long as Vettori doesn't know anything about it.
Oh, say, have you heard the news, Vettori?
No, what?
Someone knocked off Alvin McClure over at the Bronze Peacock.
McClure?
No, that's terrible.
Some guys are sure careless with the lead, all right.
What a tough break for Arnie.
It's gonna be a tough break for a lot of birds.
Well, so long.
Oh, I forgot to wish you fellas a merry Christmas.
Tony, I can't figure him.
The kid's a great driver.
- Oh, he must've lost his nerve. - I'll take care of him.
- Let's see the color of that money. - Just a minute, Sam.
I got my own ideas of a split. And you can take it or leave it.
- We ain't begging you.
- Yeah, well I bossed this job and I'm gonna get my split.
How'd you boss this job?
By sitting here cheating at solitaire?
Well, that don't go no more, not with me. We're done.
- I've been taking orders from you too long. - You'll keep on taking orders too or you'll get out of here so fast...
- Maybe it won't be me that gets out.
No?
Well, maybe the boys have got something to say about that.
What about it?
So, that's it, huh?
Yeah, that's it, all right.
You can dish it out, but you're getting so you can't take it no more. You're through.
Well?
Well, the split's okay with me, Rico.
How about you boys?
No hard feelings, Sam?
We gotta stick together.
There's a rope around my neck right now, and they only hang you once.
If anybody turns yellow and squeals my gun's gonna speak its peace.
What's the matter, Antonio?
Why you don't sleep?
- You sick, maybe?
- Yeah.
- Oh, what...
- No, can't a guy get up when he wants to without answering a lot of questions?
You stay out late nights, you drink lot of wine.
- Leave me alone. - Oh, listen, Antonio, I...
I have some spaghetti for you on the stove.
If you feel better, eat some.
Yes?
It do you good.
You used to be a good boy, Antonio.
Remember when you sing in the church?
In the choir with Father McNeil?
You in white.
Remember?
Father McNeil.
The church was beautiful.
You little boy with long hair.
The tall, big candles.
Flowers.
Remember, Antonio?
Don't leave me, Ma, do you hear?
You don't have to go now, do you?
Can't you stay a little while with me?
Please, don't go away.
- Please. - Oh, Antonio.
Oh, my baby.
I no go, I stay.
Antonio.
Oh, my boy. I'll be all right, Ma.
- You'd better run along, do you hear?
- Yes.
You run along.
Take good care of yourself, will you?
And give my love to Miss Manccia, will you?
Father McNeil.
Hey, Tony.
Where you been?
I'm looking all over for you.
Rico wants you to come and get your split.
What's the matter, Tony?
Don't you want a split?
Are you crazy?
I'm not crazy.
And I don't want no split.
Listen, Tony.
Rico knows you lose your nerve.
Now, he wants you to be a man.
You better not turn yellow.
Get away from me, Otero. Leave me alone!
Listen, kid.
I'm trying to tell you for your own good.
Come with me and get your split.
Hey, Tony!
Tony, where you going?
I'm going to see Father McNeil.
Rico!
I found Tony, but it's too late.
He's crazy!
Crazy!
I tell him to be a man, but he shakes his head and goes to the priest.
Well, I guess that's that. We ain't got any time to lose.
Come on, Sam, get a car, and let's go.
Not me!
Take... Take Scabby.
- Scabby's no good. - No.
I'm not.
- Can you drive, Otero?
- Sure!
All right, let's go. We'll use the black roadster.
There he is.
Tony!
That hearse is sure decked out pretty.
Well, this was no time to be tight with money.
Tony deserved a swell send-off.
- Poor kid. - Yeah, but Rico's wreath beat them all.
It was big.
And all it had on it was "Tony."
- Not even Rico's name.
- Yeah. Rico's no braggart.
Tony looked like he was asleep.
Didn't look a bit changed.
Beats me how they do it.
Got a match?
Look, Rico.
There's Flaherty, the bull. Things must be getting pretty hot.
What's he want?
He's just stalling. They ain't got a thing on me.
Gee, we're moving slow.
We got plenty of time. The banquet won't start until 8.
Yeah.
Too bad Tony won't be there. Yeah, that's the goods, all right.
That's the fanciest I've ever seen, Sam.
Look at those little turtledoves down here.
Friendship and loyalty, huh?
- Well, how do you like that, Sam?
- Pretty good, Rico.
Otero told me I don't look good in a derby. What do you think?
- Looks just like you. - I thought so.
I guess I'll stick to them from now on. "Compliments to a true pal. Mr. C. Bandello from a true pal Mr. Sam Vettori." Well, that's nice.
I appreciate, Sam.
What's the matter with you birds?
Don't you know how to act at a banquet?
What do you think you are, a lot of gashouse yaps?
Well, cut the chatter.
Scabby's gonna make a speech. Well, folks you all know what we're here for so what's the good of me telling you all about it?
Rico here is a great guy! Sure, and...
Well...
Say, Rico I don't know how to talk fancy, but...
This here watch is for you, see?
- From the boys! - Come on, everybody. Clap, like.
Oh, no, no, no.
- Speech! - Oh, well.
All right.
You birds want me to make a speech?
Here it goes.
I... I want to thank you, fellas, for this here banquet.
It sure is swell.
The liquor is good, so they tell me. But I don't drink it, myself.
And the food don't leave nothing to be desired.
Well, I guess we're all having a swell time and it sure is good to see all you gents with your molls here.
Well, I...
I guess that's about all. And I wish you birds wouldn't get drunk and raise Cain because that's the way a lot of birds get bumped off.
Yeah. Lay off that stuff. I know what I'm...
A couple of newspaper guys out there want to take a picture.
What do you say, boss?
Well, what do you think of that, huh?
Sure.
Send them in. Tell them to make it snappy.
- I'll see you later. - Oh, don't go away.
- We're going to have our pictures taken.
- I haven't had my picture taken in the last 15 years.
Well, what do you think of that?
15 years, he hasn't...
Come on, boys, make it snappy. Come on, now! Quiet, everybody!
We're gonna get mugged!
There you are.
Now, hold it.
Hold it, still! - Look at the guys over there. - That was a bad play you made then, Rico.
That flashlight.
- They might pick you up on that. - Well, what do I care?
Don't I want folks to see what the boys think of me?
Hey, Rico, what become of that pal of yours, that dancer guy, Joe Massara?
He didn't come.
He ain't been around in a long time.
He didn't quit on you, did he, Rico?
Bad business to quit on me, Sam.
One guy tried that on me once.
Now, you mind your own business and let me tend to my own.
What does that bull want in here?
- I'll show him where he gets off. - Careful, Rico.
Who invited you here?
You're getting up in the world, aren't you, Rico?
The downstairs is open to anybody, even cops.
But the upstairs is private.
Thanks, but I like to keep my eye on you, Rico.
You see, I'm your friend.
I like to see a young fellow getting up in the world that's all.
So long.
Hurry back.
I will.
Oh, say...
Somebody threw a brick through Meyer Blum's window last night.
Do you happen to know anything about a diamond-and-platinum watch that was stolen, do you?
If you hear anything about it, let me know, won't you?
Banquet, eh? Rico got far too far.
So now, he's got to stop.
I'm saying he's got to stop!
Oh, Arnie, are you fellas going to start another scrap?
What's the use of my paying heavy dues for protection if there's no peace?
- Don't worry.
There'll be peace soon enough.
I'm saying he's got to stop, so he's gonna stop.
He's been cutting in on my territory and that's all wet with me.
Look.
I'm sitting here, see?
I'm sitting here quiet smoking a cigarette, see?
But a couple of my boys ain't sitting here. They're out looking for Rico, and they got their gats with them too. Catch on?
It will be a wake!
Arnie, you know best.
I've never met Rico. Phelps, 2284. Hello, Otero.
This is Joe Massara.
I just found out something.
This is hot.
Tell Rico to look out. Little Arnie's gang is out to put one in him.
What's the matter?
- Where is Rico?
- You got me.
He ain't showed up yet.
Come on, quick!
We got to find him!
I want 10 of these.
Gee, you taking all these papers, Mr. Rico?
Why, sure.
Ain't I got my picture in them?
Here.
- Thanks!
Oh, no! So somebody finally put one in you.
Yeah, but they just grazed me.
The old man will be glad to hear it.
He takes such an interest in you.
Tell him the cops couldn't get me no other way, so they hired a couple of gunmen. If I wasn't on the force, I'd have done the job cheap.
Did you ever think how you'd look with a lily in your hand?
No, I never did.
I've been in this game a good many years, and I put the cuffs on a lot of mugs.
Someday, you and I are gonna take a ride, Rico and when we do, I'll have the cuffs on you too.
No buzzard like you will ever put any cuffs on Rico.
Come on, boys. I'm gonna get that swell-headed mug if it's the last thing I ever do.
Boss, I'm sorry. I should have been with you.
They thought they hit the target, boss, but bullets just bounce off of you.
It was Little Arnie, Rico. Joe Massara got the tip, and he called up.
We couldn't find you in time.
Joe, huh?
Well.
I didn't think he cared enough.
Well, that was white of him, all right.
I ought to give him a chance on my next job.
There.
Guess I didn't study medicine for nothing, did I?
Thanks, Scabby.
I'm going to see Little Arnie tonight.
If he's looking for trouble, why, that's what we got the most of.
I want Killer Peppi, Otero, Kid Bean and Bat to go with me.
Listen, handsome, open up, or you'll tell nobody nothing no more.
Tell him we're all right, and don't act nervous.
These fellas are all right.
Come on, stick them up.
Lock that door.
Where's Arnie?
In the office?
Bat, stay outside that door and don't let anybody in.
Kid, you keep them covered. Peppi and Otero, follow me.
Come on, you.
Come on!
Put them up! Put them up!
Come on!
Hello, Arnie.
- How's business?
- What's the game?
I don't know what this is all about, but it's a private row.
- You guys better beat it. - Ain't nobody gonna leave this room.
You guys are invited to this private party.
Suppose we don't want to stay?
I wouldn't stop you for the world.
Only these boys of mine have itching fingers.
Sit down, gents.
Arnie you ought to have better sense than to hire a couple of outside yaps especially bad shots.
Come on.
What is it?
Let's have it!
Arnie you're through.
You hire these mugs, they miss. Now you're through.
If you ain't out of town by tomorrow morning you won't ever leave it except in a pine box.
I'm taking over this territory.
From now on, it's mine.
You're growing, Rico.
So this is what you've been after all the time?
I seen it in your eyes the first time I met you.
You're no good, Rico.
If you think you can muscle in on me like you did on Sam Vettori, you're off your nut!
I suppose you forgot all about Pete Montana, huh?
How's Diamond Pete going to stop me?
He may be your boss, but he ain't mine.
Sam didn't feel that way about him.
- Sam knew who gave orders. - Sam was too soft.
Diamond Pete could scare him, but I ain't no Sam.
Sam is through.
Now you're through too.
Nice stickpin you got there, Arnie.
Nothing phony about my jewelry.
Arnie you better quit this racket.
You can dish it out, but you got so that you can't take it no more.
You'd better take your hats and beat it.
The first thing you know, you'll be arrested for firing a rod in the city limits.
Well I guess that's about all.
Pleasant trip, gents.
Come on, boys.
Oh, thanks, boys, for the artillery. - Well, boys. What do you think of it?
That means you have a new partner.
Little Caesar. Everybody'll laugh at Scabby's story.
Gee, boss.
You gave Arnie an awful walloping.
Rico...
Now you're famous.
You see, Otero.
There ain't no use in being scared of any of these big guys.
The bigger they come, the harder they fall.
Yeah.
I ain't doing so bad in this business so far.
Well, now.
You look great, boss.
Yeah, but it feels terrible.
You're getting up in the world, Rico.
None of us ever been invited up to eat at the Big Boy's dump.
And nobody ever crashed the gate except Pete Montana.
See what I mean?
Now, you don't want the Big Boy to think you ain't got no class.
They rig you up better than this in the stir.
If you think I'm going out in this, you're crazy!
You look fine, boss.
- Go on.
Take a peek at yourself. - Oh, I don't know.
All I need is a napkin over my arm.
Now, don't you look fine?
Yeah.
I guess maybe I don't look so bad after all.
Oh, hello.
- Hello, Big Boy. - Hello, Rico.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Thanks.
Thanks very much.
Well, you're rather lit up tonight, aren't you?
Yeah. I thought I better put on a monkey suit.
That's right.
You may as well learn now.
Yeah.
Well...
Some joint you got here.
It'll do.
I bet all this trick furniture set you back plenty, huh?
Well, they don't exactly give it away with cigar coupons.
Well, I'll tell the world.
Boy, it sure look...
Oh, look at that.
- Do you like it?
- Oh, I think it's elegant.
That cost me $ 15,000.
Fifteen thou... Boy, them gold frames sure cost plenty of dough.
Well, will you have a cocktail or a dash of brandy?
Oh, no, thanks. I never touch the stuff.
No?
- Cigar, then?
- Oh, yeah.
I'll have one of those.
Thanks.
Thanks very much.
- Sit down, Rico. - Yeah. Thanks.
Now, listen, Rico.
I'm gonna talk to you, but you're not gonna hear a word I say, see?
This is inside dope, and if it gets out, it'll be just too bad for somebody.
You know me.
All right. Get this.
Pete Montana's through.
Yeah?
Well.
- And I thought he was such a big guy. - He's through.
Suppose I were to tell you that from now on you were Pete Montana.
That you were to take over his territory in addition to your own.
Would you shake on it?
Would I?
Would I?
All right.
It's set.
I'm doing a lot for you, Rico, but when I get you planted I'll expect plenty of service.
Well, you'll sure get it.
Permit me, then, to drink to the new boss of the North Side.
Thank you.
Otero, what did I tell you, huh?
I knew it was coming.
I knew he had his eyes on me all the time.
And let me tell you something, Otero.
It's not only Pete Montana that's through, but the Big Boy himself.
He ain't what he used to be.
Pretty soon, he won't be able to take it, and then watch me.
Sure, boss.
Pretty soon, you'll be running the whole town.
Otero, you said a mouthful.
There's a guy by the name of Massara out there. He wants to see you, sir.
- I'll see him in a minute. - Yes, sir.
What's Joe want here?
He hasn't been near any of us for months.
I sent for him.
I heard somebody in Detroit got to Flaherty and told him to start working on a dancer at the Bronze Peacock if he wanted to find out who shot McClure.
Gee, boss, you're wise to everything before it happens.
Yeah, I don't miss much.
I'll soon find out if Flaherty's been working on Joe after I have a little talk with him.
Gee, Rico, what a palace.
Oh, hello, Joe.
Yeah, it'll do.
But what do you expect?
Ain't I got 20 grand tied up in it?
- Hello, Otero.
How are you, baby? - First-rate.
Sit down, Joe.
Sure I'm good enough to sit in such a swell chair?
Come on, now.
Cut the comedy. Sit down.
Screw, Otero.
- I want to talk with Joe private. - Sure.
See you later, Joe.
- Cigar, Joe?
- No, thanks.
Well, will you have a cocktail or a dash of brandy?
No.
Well, it surprise you to hear from me?
Kind of.
I thought it would be kind of nice to have a little talk together like old times.
Certainly is nice to see you, Rico.
Especially like this.
- You're looking good. - You're looking good too, Joe.
Living easy, kind of, huh?
- Not that easy.
Dancing's no cinch. - Yeah, but you ain't complaining.
- No.
No, I ain't complaining. - That's good.
Yeah.
Dancing's all right for a sideline.
It gives you a swell front.
But it ain't my idea of a man's game.
What's the difference, Rico?
As long as I ain't kicking, why should you kick?
Who's kicking?
Only why should a young guy like you be wasting his time?
And I kind of took pride in you, Joe brought you into the gang, pushed you ahead.
But now you're getting to be a sissy.
We got to go into that again?
Can't you just forget about me?
I don't want to forget, Joe.
You're my pal. We started off together, didn't we?
We've got to keep going along together.
Who else do I got to give a hang about?
I need you, Joe.
I've got the biggest chance of my life.
The Big Boy just handed me the whole North Side but it's too much for one man to handle alone.
I need somebody, a guy like you somebody I can trust.
- Can't be me, Rico.
I've quit.
You didn't quit.
Nobody ever quit me.
You're still in my gang, you got that?
I don't care how many fancy skirts you've got hanging on to you.
That jane's made a softy out of you.
- You lay off Olga. - I ain't laying off.
I'm after her!
One of us has to lose, and it won't be me. There's ways of stopping that dame.
- You're crazy.
Leave her out of this! - She's through, out of the way.
- You're lying.
You wouldn't dare! - I wouldn't?
- I'll show you! - Rico, listen.
We're in love with one another. Don't that mean nothing?
Nothing.
Less than nothing.
Love.
Soft stuff!
When she's got you, you ain't no good for anything.
We ain't out of this yet and we don't want no softies spilling things!
I won't spill anything, if you're scared of that.
- You think I want my neck stretched?
- Well, you know too much.
I ain't gonna take any chances. You're hanging around with me, see?
No, I'm not.
All right.
You go back to that dame and it's suicide.
Suicide for both of you. Just stick here.
Hello?
Oh, hello, Big Boy.
No. No, I don't want that guy. I don't trust him.
Yeah.
I got a kid by the name of Joe Massara who'll help me.
Yeah.
All right, goodbye, Big Boy.
Oh, Joe... - Joe. - Olga.
- We've gotta go.
Hurry! - Joe, what's the matter?
Didn't you hear what I said?
Hurry! Hurry!
- Yes, Joe.
Oh, you're ill. - I'm all right.
- Rico. - What did he do to you?
Oh, didn't I know it?
He, Rico...
He said you and me got to quit.
He'd kill you unless I stuck with him. I ran away.
We've got to get out of here. Anywhere.
As long as we get away!
No.
- No?
You're not coming?
- No.
That's not the way.
But, Olga, you don't know that guy!
- Olga, you've got to!
Please! - No.
Sit down, Joe.
- We've got to think. - I don't want to think or sit down.
- You're coming. - Don't you see?
It would be no use!
Where?
Where would we go?
Where would we run to?
There's no place he wouldn't find us.
There's only one thing for us to do.
Flaherty.
You're crazy. You think that would save us?
Flaherty?
That's worse than suicide.
- I won't do it. I can't.
- Well, I can do it.
That gang must go.
Rico must go.
I want my happiness, Joe.
I want you.
We'll never have peace till Rico's gone. I'm going to do it.
Olga, don't!
Please!
Stay here!
Olga, open this door!
Olga, open this door!
Hurry!
Park, 1000.
Olga. Don't call Flaherty.
Please, open this door, quickly!
Rico will kill us both!
Headquarters, I want Sergeant Flaherty.
Sergeant Flaherty, this is Olga Stassoff.
I've got Joe Massara with me. In my apartment. 17 Edsel Drive.
Come on, boys, we're going to a party.
Who's giving the party?
- Joe Massara. - Formal or informal?
I don't know, but we'll find out when we get there.
You shouldn't have done it. You shouldn't have.
There was no other way. No other right way.
- It's the rope for me. - No, it isn't.
Not if you turn state's evidence.
We'll make them promise everything will be okay. Wait, Olga!
- Joe!
- There he is, the dirty double-crosser.
Give it to him, Rico!
No.
Shoot.
Shoot, Rico.
Get it over with.
Come on, Otero!
Let's go!
You're getting soft too. What's the matter with you? Come on!
Joe.
Through the window!
Go on, boys.
Go and get him!
Are you ready to talk now, Joe?
Well, I'll talk.
It was Rico's gang that held up the Bronze Peacock.
It was Rico who shot McClure.
That dirty, low, sneaking... Well, Joe will tell you.
Ask him.
He knows it was Rico.
Is that right, Joe?
Was it Rico?
- Where's your phone?
- In there.
Oh, Joe.
Here, let me help you.
Park, 1000.
Hello, Dan, this is Flaherty.
Round up that Palermo gang.
I got enough on them to use a mile of rope.
Shoot the cars right out, and above all, get Rico. We've gotta watch our step. The cops are sure to be cruising around.
- You should have plugged Joe. - And the dame.
If they ain't squealed about McClure yet, they'll do it now.
- From now on, we're hot. - Yeah.
This is what I get for liking a guy too much.
Come on.
Halt!
Halt! Go on, Rico.
I'm done for.
Go on, Rico. Sam! Sam!
Joe Massara!
They nabbed him over the McClure business, and he squawked.
Rico tried to get him. Now they're after him.
They got Otero.
- Otero?
- Sam, don't you get me?
- What are you sitting there for?
- What else can I do?
I can't run now. They'd get me anyhow.
You're out of your head. Come on, get up.
Let's beat it!
It's no use. Put them up! Don't move!
Hand over your guns.
All right.
Drop that gun before we start shooting. Come on in.
Get on your feet and put your hands up.
Put the cuffs on him.
You ain't got nothing on me.
Nothing but the bracelets.
And we haven't got a thing on Rico, either.
He's next.
- There's nobody in there. - No?
Well, listen, Ma.
If you see Rico, you'd better let us know, quick.
Well you got yourself in a nice fix.
- Yeah. - The cops were just here.
They got Otero.
Ma, I'm gonna stay here a day or two, then I want a car.
Gonna cost you big, because I'm taking big chances.
I got 10 grand planted here. Help yourself.
When you're ready to start, I'll give you $ 150.
You'll give me?
Whose money is this?
Who do you think you're talking to?
I need plenty.
My money is hidden in the apartment. I can't get to it.
I'll give you $ 150. Take it or leave it.
Why, you dirty, thieving old hag, I'll...
No, you won't.
Because I'm the only one knows where the money's hid.
Kill me, and you won't get a cent.
I'll give you $ 150 if you'll be a good boy.
He was mean, Sam Vettori was.
So now he's got what was coming to him.
What does it say in the paper?
"Former gang chief faints on scaffold.
After a futile battle in the courts Sam Vettori, former gang leader today presented a pitiful figure as the hangman's noose was placed around his neck."
Listen. "Little Caesar has never been found.
According to the statement of Lieutenant Thomas Flaherty of the homicide squad Little Caesar, the once swaggering braggart of the underworld wilted in the face of real danger and showed the world his cowardice.
Flaherty stated further that Little Caesar has contradicted his oft-repeated boast that he could dish it out and take it too."
Yeah.
"When a real crisis arose Rico couldn't take it.
Flaherty ended his interview by remarking:
'Meteoric as was Rico's rise from the gutter it was inevitable that he should return there."'
Well, just the same, he was the real leader of that gang.
Don't you believe it.
Rico didn't have the nerve, and he didn't have the brains.
He was yellow, just like Flaherty said. Here!
- That's what Rico...
Hey, watch it!
- What's the matter with him?
Trying to put that kind of stuff about me in the papers, huh?
I'll show them...
Hello?
Hello?
I want Park, 1000.
Yeah. Yeah, I can't take it no more, huh?
I'll tell that guy where to... Hello?
Park, 1000?
- Get me Flaherty, and get him quick. - Sure. Just a minute.
Tom.
Oh, Tom.
I may be screwy, but this sounds like Rico.
Yeah?
- Flaherty speaking.
- Yeah, this is Rico speaking!
Rico!
R-l-C-O, Rico!
Little Caesar, that's who!
You're a big guy, ain't you?
Shooting your mouth off in the papers.
So I ran out when it got hot, huh?
I can't take it no more?
Well, listen, you crummy, flatfooted copper I'll show you whether I lost my nerve.
Thanks, Rico, old boy.
The same to you and many of them.
Come on, tell me some more.
The sound of your voice does my heart good.
Trace that call. Find out where he's phoning from, quick. Say, why didn't you come to Sam's neck-stretching party, Rico?
It was a big success.
Funny guy, ain't you, Flaherty?
Well, you ain't got much longer to laugh.
I'm coming, and I'm gonna put one in your dirty hide for every lying crack that you made about me, see?
I'll show you who's gonna finish up in the gutter.
We've missed you, Rico.
The town has been nice and quiet.
I'm putting on weight.
River, 6547.
It's a flophouse down at 4th and Commercial.
All right. All right, big mouth.
Get your hat and start running, see, because you're all through.
Call the papers and tell them that, you rotten, dirty, lying copper! I knew we'd hear from that guy if I kept giving it to him in the papers.
The conceit of that guy!
They'll have to build a special noose to get that swelled head of his through. Well, wish me luck.
There he is.
That's Rico, all right.
Pull in there.
You'd better give up, Rico. You haven't got a chance.
You'll have to come and get me.
You'd better be a nice boy, Rico, and come out.
You heard me! If you want me, come and get me!
I'll be with you in a minute.
Give me that chopper.
This is your last chance, Rico.
Are you coming out, or do you want to be carried out?
Well, Rico, it looks like you and I are going to take that little ride together.
No...
No, we ain't.
I told you a little buzzard like you will never put any cuffs on me.
You should have come out when I told you to, Rico. Mother of mercy.
Is this the end of Rico?
Come in.
- What is it, Poole?
- It's 2:45, sir... and your address at the University is at 3:00.
So it is, Poole.
- You know, Poole?
You're a nuisance.
- Yes, sir.
But I don't know what I should do without you.
Thank you, sir.
Your sense of duty is as impregnable as Gibraltar.
- Even Bach can't move it. - Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
I'm afraid you'll be late, sir.
I see you want to get rid of me.
All right, Poole.
They're lovely roses, Poole.
Thank you, sir.
- Will you wear your overcoat or cape, sir?
- Give me my cape.
- Good afternoon, Jasper.
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Nice day, isn't it?
- Isn't it, sir?
- St. Simon's.
- Yes, sir.
Constable.
- How are you, sir?
- Very good. Thank you, sir.
I won't need you anymore today, Jasper.
Dr. Lanyon will take me where I'm going later.
Yes, sir.
- How do you do, Dr. Jekyll?
- How do you do?
- Hello, Hampton.
- Afternoon, sir.
The auditorium's full, sir.
It always is when you speak, sir.
Flattery!
- I hope Jekyll's in form today.
- He's always in form.
The old codgers are in for another jolt.
I'd wager your friend has something up his sleeve again, Dr. Lanyon.
Jekyll is always sensational, always indulging in spectacular theories.
Gentlemen...
London is so full of fog... that it has penetrated our minds... set boundaries for our vision.
As men of science, we should be curious... and bold enough to peer beyond it... into the many wonders it conceals.
I shall not dwell today on the secrets of the human body... in sickness and in health.
Today, I want to talk to you of a greater marvel:
The soul of man.
My analysis of this soul, the human psyche... leads me to believe that man is not truly one... but truly two.
One of him strives for the nobilities of life.
This we call his good self.
The other seeks an expression of impulses... that bind him to some dim animal relation with the earth.
This, we may call the bad.
These two carry out an eternal struggle in the nature of man... yet they are chained together.
And that chain spells repression to the evil.
Remorse to the good.
Now, if these two selves could be separated from each other... how much freer the good in us would be.
What heights it might scale.
And the so-called evil, once liberated... would fulfill itself and trouble us no more.
I believe the day is not far off... when this separation will be possible.
In my experiments, I have found... that certain chemicals have the power...
Tell me, he can split me in two like a jolly amoeba.
- By Jove, it's marvelous.
- I confess it's too much for me.
Why don't you stay at home and send your other self to the lecture?
To divide a human being in two?
Ridiculous!
I'm going to try to analyze my psyche.
- I didn't expect you to agree with me.
- Agree with you?
You talk like a lunatic.
But I hope you're sane enough to remember... that we have a consultation at the Duchess of Densmore's.
- I'm not going.
- What?
Please give the duchess my compliments and some castor oil.
I saw her yesterday.
She's a bit bilious, more in spirit than in body, I'm afraid.
- I'm going along the free wards.
- My dear fellow, be reasonable.
You know how insistent the duchess was on your coming.
You can't neglect her for a lot of charity cases.
Can't I?
It's the things one can't do that always tempt me.
Just as you like.
But you'll remember we're having dinner at the Carews' tonight.
- I'll pick you up later.
- Thanks.
You'll find me in the wards.
See you at 9:00.
Mary, what are you doing with those crutches?
I can't do without them, sir.
Yes, you can do without them, Mary.
I told you yesterday.
Believe me, I can't do anything for you.
I believe you, sir... but I can't walk without them, sir.
Yes, you can. Give them to me.
Don't be afraid.
Now walk, Mary. Come on. Come to me.
Yes, sir.
Walk, Mary. Come on.
All right, sir. I can walk, sir.
- Of course you can.
- I can walk, sir!
There, there, Mrs. Lucas.
- It hurts, doesn't it?
- Yes, sir.
Sometimes a doctor must hurt you a little to make you well.
Yes, sir.
And if a doctor thinks a slight operation is necessary... there's no need to be afraid, is there?
- No, sir.
- I want you to know it's going to cure you.
I believe you, sir.
Jekyll, we haven't much time, you know.
I'm sorry.
I'm afraid I must miss the dinner.
I'll come afterwards for the dancing.
- What's keeping you?
- I must operate on this patient at once.
Why not leave it to one of the house surgeons?
They're quite competent.
Perhaps, but I prefer to do it myself.
Will you make my excuses to General Carew and Muriel, please?
As you like.
Lanyon, you make my excuses to the General... and I'll make mine to Muriel myself.
All right.
Yes, Miss Muriel.
Will it be almond cakes with coffee, Hobson?
- I'm sorry, miss.
I don't think so.
- But we must have almond cakes.
- Send for them immediately.
- Very good, miss.
- What's this about almond cakes?
- Dr. Jekyll likes them, Father.
You know you'll spoil that fiancé of yours.
- I like spoiling him.
- So I observe.
And what about your father?
You're already the most spoiled darling in the world.
Dr. Lanyon.
Lanyon. Delighted to see you.
Punctual for dinner, punctual in everything.
How do you do, sir?
- What an astonishing motto.
- How do you do?
- Where's Jekyll?
- He stayed to perform an operation.
- Isn't he coming?
- He will be in after dinner.
He asked me to make his excuses.
I hope the patient is worthy of Jekyll's attention.
- A woman in the free wards.
- Free ward.
Jekyll gives entirely too much time to his charity patients.
I love him for that.
Nonsense, my dear.
He ought to come down to earth.
- Mr. Utterson.
- Utterson.
However, I promised Harry the first waltz.
If he's late, I shall be furious with him.
No.
You know, I'm very glad Jekyll is late.
I'm obliged to him for a most delightful waltz.
Thank you.
Hello, General.
I'm very sorry to be late, sir.
Repentance is a virtue, Jekyll, but it's better to be punctual.
In 40 years, I've never been late for dinner.
It's indeed a remarkable record, sir.
Merely a matter of training, my boy. At the age of...
General, you've not forgotten this is our dance?
Certainly not, Lady Dakin. I've been looking forward to it.
See you later, Jekyll.
May I?
- I shouldn't.
- But you will.
- Was she pretty?
- Ravishing.
- Who?
- Your patient.
I was thinking of someone else.
Someone to make you late again?
- Are you chiding me?
- Of course.
- Because you hate me?
- Of course, silly.
Then, will you come into the garden where I can bear it?
- Certainly not.
- Why not?
- Father. He'd be furious.
- It would do him good.
He's not looking.
He's teaching Lady Dakin how to waltz.
- Can't stay long.
- Just forever.
Not even half as long as that.
Now, my farthing, chide me, mock me, hate me... but don't send me away.
Silly.
Are you sorry you were late?
- No.
- You're not?
- If I wasn't late, you wouldn't have pouted.
- I won't forgive...
If you hadn't pouted, you wouldn't have looked so pretty.
Do you talk this way to your patients?
If you hadn't looked so pretty, I might have postponed...
- Pardon me.
- Not another word.
Well?
I might have postponed telling you that I love you so much... and I don't want to wait any longer.
I want you to marry me now.
Darling, I want to with all my heart.
You know I do.
But Father's so difficult.
I don't want to marry your father.
I don't mind having a difficult father-in-law.
You'll be worth it, my darling.
I don't think you love me seriously.
I love you better than that.
I love you gaily, happily, high-heartedly.
I love you so much that I could laugh and sing and...
I shouldn't spoil it by trying to sing.
My darling, I shall persuade your father to let us marry now.
I can't wait any longer.
We shall go to Devon for our honeymoon and live on love and strawberries... and the sight of the sea.
- And moonlight.
- Endless moonlight.
I do love you seriously.
So seriously that it frightens me.
You've opened a gate for me into another world.
Before that, my work was everything.
I was drawn to the mysteries of science, to the unknown.
But now, the unknown wears your face... looks back at me with your eyes.
Darling, I wish this moment would last forever.
You can make it last, dear.
I love you.
Be near me always.
Always you and I.
Apart from the world.
I love you, darling.
I love you.
Then who shall ever separate us?
- My sweet friend.
- My love.
You ought to wear squeaky shoes, Hobson.
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
The General asks you to come into the house, miss.
- Your guests are inquiring about you.
- Coming, Hobson.
- Glad you came. - Good night, Muriel.
- You looked perfectly lovely tonight.
- Thank you.
- Good-bye, my dear.
- Good night, General.
I don't know when I've enjoyed myself so much.
- I'll see you at tea tomorrow, dear.
- Yes.
I won't forget, Lady Dakin.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Jekyll, my boy.
Waiting to see me?
I beg your pardon, sir, but you would make us very happy... if you'd set an earlier date for our wedding.
I've already announced to you... that you would be married on the anniversary of my own wedding.
- That's eight months from now, sir.
- What of it?
We've already been engaged two months, sir.
We see no reason to...
I presume I have some rights in the matter.
- Quite right.
That's why we're asking you.
- Why this impatience?
It isn't done.
I'm sorry, sir, but I cannot regard that as a serious objection.
Do you hear this, Lanyon?
Is this another evidence of your eccentricity?
If it is eccentric to be impatient in love, sir, I am.
This is positively indecent.
Father, do you think it fair to keep us apart for so long?
- I waited five years for your mother.
- You have a sturdy temperament, General.
Yes, I pride myself on it.
Please don't make me wait that long for Muriel.
Now, my boy, you must leave these matters to me.
There's such a thing as decent observance, you know.
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Lanyon.
- Good night, sir.
Au revoir, my sweet.
Come, Lanyon.
- Good night, Muriel.
- Good night.
- I'm afraid you offended the General.
- Offended him?
It's a pity I didn't strangle the old walrus.
Did you hear him? "Wait!"
What the devil does one wait for?
I hope the responsibilities of marriage will sober you up.
I'm not marrying to be sober.
I'm marrying to be drunk.
- Drunk with love and life and experiments.
- Your experiments are absurd.
You have no interest in science at all.
You have no dreams, no curiosities.
There are bounds beyond which one should not go.
Yes.
It isn't done, I suppose. I tell you, there are no bounds, Lanyon.
Look at that gas lamp.
But for some man's curiosity, we shouldn't have had it.
London would still be lighted by linkboys.
And wait.
One day, London will glow with incandescence... and will be so beautiful that even you will be moved by it.
I find London quite satisfactory as it is... and I'm not interested in your shortcuts and your byways.
But it's in the byways that the secrets and wonders lie:
In science and in life.
Look at the...
Fine, you big brute, hit me!
I'll put the police on you!
Are you badly hurt?
Where does this girl live?
First door on the left at the top of the stairs.
Bring her up here.
Make way for the governor.
Have you got her, governor?
- Right up here?
- Yes. Look out for her head.
Shut up, you lot!
What was this all about?
- One of Ivy Pearson's callers...
- I can tell you...
Now shut up!
One of Ivy...
That swine.
Hit me, will he?
He'll wish he hadn't!
I ain't afraid of him, I ain't.
Blast his dirty mug!
He's killed me, that's what he's done.
He's broken me jaw and me knee, too.
I'll get him for this!
Look where he kicked me.
It's only a bruise.
It will be quite well in a few days.
Either way, you mustn't wear so tight a garter.
It's bad for you.
It impedes the circulation.
It's awful kind of you to look after me.
Anybody can see now that you're a real gent, you are.
Now you're the kind a woman would do something for.
- What is it?
- He's hit me here, too, the blighter.
He's broken me rib.
That's what he's done.
I'm going to faint.
You're not seriously hurt.
A bit of rest would do you no harm, though.
You think I ought to go to bed?
I know of no better place for a rest.
All right. You turn your eyes away now.
How is the pain now?
I say!
Lanyon.
Coming.
I'm a doctor, you know, and I'll call that kiss my fee.
Well?
Come back soon, won't you?
- Sorry. I'm afraid I can't.
- Yes, you can.
Soon.
- Good night.
- Come back.
Come back soon, won't you?
Yes, you can.
Soon, come back...
- I thought your conduct quite disgusting.
- Conduct?
Why, a pretty girl kissed me.
Should I have called the constable?
- Even suppose I'd liked it. - What?
Yes. That's not a matter of conduct, but of elementary instinct.
You ought to control those instincts.
Are you pretending that you either can or do?
We may control our actions, but not our impulses.
Perhaps you've forgotten you're engaged to Muriel.
Forgotten it?
Can a man dying of thirst forget water?
Did you know what would happen to that thirst if it were denied water?
If I understand you correctly, you sound almost indecent.
What names you give things.
Why aren't you frank enough to admit that other indecent self in you?
No. You prefer to hide it, pretend it isn't there.
- You have to accept certain things.
- I don't want to accept.
I want to be clean, not only in my conduct, but in my innermost thoughts and desires.
- There's only one way to do it.
- How?
- Separate the two natures in us.
- That absurd theory of yours.
I tell you, it's unscientific not to admit the possibility of anything.
You're mad.
Mad, Lanyon?
We'll see.
Come in.
What is it, Poole?
Begging your pardon for the intrusion, sir, but did you sleep last night, sir?
Don't worry about me.
Yes, sir, but you had only a cup of tea for breakfast for three days.
Your health!
Now, Poole, you didn't come here to inquire after my health, did you?
One of General Carew's servants brought this, sir.
Miss Muriel is scolding me for having missed her dinner last night.
Go and tell her that I shall come to dinner tomorrow night.
Very good, sir.
Marry me now. I cannot wait any longer.
Positively indecent.
Look where he kicked me.
Your conduct was disgusting.
It isn't done!
Pity I didn't strangle him.
Strangle him!
Indecent!
Can a man dying of thirst forget water?
Disgusting.
You're mad.
Come back soon, won't you?
Come back.
Free!
Free at last!
Mad, Lanyon?
Carew?
You hypocrites, deniers of life.
If you could see me now... what would you think?
- Who is it?
- Who is there?
Dr. Jekyll, sir.
Is that you?
Do you hear me, sir?
Please let me in, sir!
I beg your pardon, sir.
I thought I heard a strange voice.
That's quite all right.
There was someone here.
A friend of mine.
His name is Hyde. Mr. Hyde.
He's just gone out the back door.
Marry me now, my darling.
You don't know how much I need you.
I want to with all my heart, but Father...
- I'll speak to him.
I'll convince him.
- No. Let me talk to him.
I'll try to change his mind while we're away.
- Away?
- Yes.
Darling, I've dreaded telling you... but Father's taking me to Bath tomorrow.
He has no right to take you away from me.
Why must we put up with this?
- You want to marry me?
- With all my heart.
We'll marry without his consent.
Say you will, my darling.
We'll go to Paris for our honeymoon.
We'll be so gloriously happy... that even the French will be jealous of us.
I'm so thrilled and tempted, but I don't want to hurt my father.
It's only a little hurt to his vanity.
You'll do me a greater hurt if you refuse.
Do be patient, just a little while.
I'm sure I can persuade him while we're gone.
- Darling, don't you love me enough... to wait a little while?
Of course I love you enough, dear.
And I'll wait.
And wait.
Come in.
A letter from Bath, sir.
Miss Muriel won't be home for another month.
- Can't even go to see her.
- I'm sorry to hear it, sir.
- Another month.
- I beg your pardon, sir... but may I suggest that you ought to amuse yourself.
Amuse myself?
What do you suggest, Poole?
You ought to go out, sir.
London offers many amusements for a gentleman like you, sir.
Yes, but a gentleman like me daren't take advantage of them.
Gentlemen like me must be very careful of what they do and say.
- That's all.
- Yes, sir.
Here!
What are you after down there?
I was calling on the young lady who occupies the little nest.
If it's Ivy Pearson you mean, she ain't in.
Do you know where I can find her?
If I was wanting her, I'd try the Variety Music Hall.
I thank you!
You get out!
What do you take me for?
Get out!
- Stay out!
- I didn't do nothing.
Bottle of champagne and be quick about it.
- What are you staring at?
- Nothing, sir.
What are you waiting for?
A tip? Get out!
Blighter.
- I'm sorry, sir.
- You swine!
He's a rum one.
Let's have a drink.
I will.
You're a bit of something to look at and listen to, dearie.
Not half bad, so they say.
- You ain't conceited, are you?
- I has me points.
- Charlie!
- Blimey, there's Irv.
I'll be back.
Hey, you!
Tell that wenching brat to come over and have a bottle of wine with me.
- Yes, sir.
- That's right.
The gent there wants you to have wine with him.
He does, does he?
What of it?
Come if you know what's good for you.
He ain't one to be trifled with.
Strike me pink. You interest me.
I'll take a chance.
- Where is he?
- I'll take you to him.
This is indeed a great honor.
I noticed you as you came in, my dear.
"There," I said to myself...
"is too pretty a girl to waste on such a companion."
But you are pretty.
And what a figure, my dear.
A glass of champagne. To you, my dear.
To your beauty.
- I must be going now.
- Going. Where?
- Home.
- You call that home?
- That pigsty of yours in Diadem Court.
- Sty, is it?
You come off that.
I like you when your temper's up, my dear.
How do you know where I live?
I saw you on the street and followed you.
My pretty, you deserve better than that.
You ought to live in a place worthy of you.
Buckingham Palace, I suppose.
That's the spirit I like. Sit down, my dear.
Sit down just for a moment.
You should have a place that would set off that fine body of yours... yellow hair and pale face.
Clothes to match, too, my dear.
Silk, eh?
And a bracelet, too?
Champagne to drink? How would you like that?
And how am I to get it?
How do you think you're going to get it, my bright little bird?
I am no gentleman, no, but I have money.
Perhaps my looks don't please you.
- You ain't no beauty.
- Quite right.
I am no beauty.
Perhaps you prefer a gentleman?
One of those fine-mannered, virtuous, and honorable gentlemen.
One of those canting hypocrites who like your legs... but talk about your garter.
What are you talking about?
My poor little innocent.
It doesn't know what I'm talking about.
Well, it's afraid of me, isn't it?
- No! I ain't afraid of you.
- Aren't you?
Good.
Hey, you. Trying to steal my girl, are you, you dirty blighter?
- Come back, you. I'll fix you...
- Sit down!
- I'll knock your blooming...
- Get out of here, you!
- You couldn't have done it.
- Couldn't I, though?
Why not?
This place was just made for it.
- Come on.
- Stop that. Let me go.
- No. You're not going. - Let me go!
I'm going!
I'm going home!
Sit down!
Forgive me, my dear.
You see, I hurt you because I love you.
I want you... and what I want, I get.
I grant you, I am no beauty... but under this exterior... you'll find a very flower of man.
Look at me.
Do you suppose I'd let anybody stand in my way?
I love you.
I love you.
Do you understand?
You'll come with me?
You'll come with me.
Come in, sir.
- I presume your master is out.
- Yes, sir. So he is, sir.
He's always out when I call.
Tell your master I've had a letter from General Carew.
He tells me that Dr. Jekyll has not replied to any of Miss Muriel's letters.
- She's worried about him.
- I'll tell him, sir.
Anyway, I'm relieved to know he's not confined to his bed.
Begging your pardon, sir, it's my opinion that my master isn't well.
He hardly sees his patients, sir.
I haven't seen him myself for days at a time.
He often comes and goes by the back door of the laboratory, sir.
I must be going, Poole. Good day.
- Who's there?
- It's me, dearie, your landlady.
Come in, Mrs. Hawkins.
How are you, dearie?
You don't have to answer.
I can see for myself you ain't as fit as you ought to be... and no wonder.
- Here, I brought you the newspaper.
- Thank you, Mrs. Hawkins.
You're having a cup of tea, I see.
If you don't mind, dearie, I'll sit with you a minute.
I'm that done in.
Will you have a cup of tea, Mrs. Hawkins?
Thank you, dearie.
I don't mind if I do.
After all, a neighbor's a neighbor, says I.
Here's a bit of a surprise for you.
He's a lodger of mine, and a very likely lad he is, too.
His name's Arvis, and he says to me, says he:
"Who's the pretty lass what has the parlor?
"I wonder if she'd be inclined to drop in at the music hall with me...
"one of these fine nights.
"You ask her," says he.
Now, my advice, dearie...
No.
I don't want to hear anymore about it.
Afraid of what Hyde will do to you, ain't you?
No, I ain't afraid.
If that blighter was my man, he wouldn't dare to lay a hand on me... not if he knowed what was good for him.
He's a brute, that's what he is, and my advice, dearie...
- What do you want?
- I've come for the rent, sir.
- You'll get it when it's due.
- Very good, sir.
What did that filthy harridan want?
She brought me the paper.
- What else?
- Nothing.
You aren't lying to me, are you, my little bird?
No, I ain't lying to you.
If I ever catch you lying... these are a trifle to what you'll get.
A trifle!
Come here.
Sit down so that I can look at you, my sweetling.
- Say it aloud.
- What do you mean?
Don't you think I can read your thoughts, you trull?
You hate me, don't you?
I'm not good enough for you!
I'm not a nice, kind gentleman like that...
Nice, kind gentlemen who are so good to look at and so...
Cowards!
Weaklings!
Tell me you hate me. Please, my lamb.
My dear, sweet, pretty little bird, tell me that you hate me.
- I don't know what you mean.
- Don't you, my lamb?
- Then you don't hate me?
- No, sir.
If you don't hate me, you must love me.
- Isn't that so, my little one?
Isn't it?
- Yes, sir.
How you must love me.
I want to hear you say it.
- Say it.
Come, my wench.
Say it!
- Yes, sir!
Of course.
I've got bad news for you, my dear.
Very bad.
I'm going away for a few days.
And upon my word, if you don't seem pleased.
- And you are pleased, aren't you?
- No, sir, I ain't pleased.
You are pleased!
But pleasure is brief in this world, my sweet... and yours is most uncertain... because you don't know when I'll be back.
Do you?
- No, sir.
- "No, sir."
Remember, you belong to me, do you hear?
If you do one thing that I don't approve of while I'm gone... the least little thing, mind you...
I'll show you what horror means.
Are you going now?
- Tonight?
- Now.
Why, my dear, I'm surprised at you.
What a leave-taking that would be.
You wouldn't have me go tonight, would you?
Would you let me go tonight?
Would you?
- No, sir.
- Of course not.
Quite unworthy of our great love.
No, my dear, I'm not going now.
I'm going to spend the evening here with you just as you want.
Say, "Just as I want."
- "Just as I want."
- That's right, my little bird.
The last evening is always the sweetest, you know.
And what a farewell this one will be.
What a farewell.
I don't know whether I shall be able to tear myself away from you.
Perhaps I shall go only as far as the door... and the sight of your tears will bring me back.
- Does that please you, my dear?
- Yes, sir.
Why don't you show it, then?
Why don't you dance?
Why don't you sing?
Sing, my dear!
Sing, my little pigeon!
Get up and sing!
You hear?
Look, my darling, how tight your garter is.
You mustn't wear it so tight.
It will bruise your pretty, tender flesh.
Your tea, sir.
Thank you, Poole.
I shall be going out presently.
- Miss Muriel is returning to London today.
- Very good, sir.
- See this key, Poole?
- Yes, sir.
It's the key to the back door of the laboratory, sir.
I'll have no further use for it.
From now on, I'll use only the front door.
Yes, sir.
Deliver this to Miss Ivy Pearson, Diadem Court, Soho.
- Any message, sir?
- None. Deliver it and come away.
- Hyde'll kill you one day.
- I wish he would kill me.
I wish he would.
Why don't you run away?
Where to?
He'd find me wherever I was.
Then why don't you go to the police?
They'd fix this Hyde man.
No. I'm afraid.
There ain't nobody to help me.
Nobody.
Who cares what becomes of the likes of me?
Come in.
Miss Ivy Pearson?
- That's me.
- This is from my master, Dr. Jekyll, miss.
- Not Dr. Henry L. Jekyll?
- Quite so.
He said there is no answer.
Good day, miss.
I don't know Dr. Jekyll.
Fifty pounds!
Well, he knows you, dearie.
Strike me pink!
Fifty pounds from the celebrated Dr. Jekyll.
He's a grand gentleman, always helping them what needs help.
Now, dearie, he sends you fifty pounds... shows he takes an interest in you.
Why don't you go and thank the gentleman proper?
Then you could tell him all about this here Hyde business.
He'll tell that blighter what's what.
You'll see if he don't.
You made me suffer so.
Now you tell me nothing.
I tell you no man ever needed another or loved another... as I need and love you.
I don't know what to say... but if you'd been ill that would have been different.
I was ill, my darling.
Why didn't you let me know?
I should have come at once.
I wasn't ill in body. I was ill in soul.
The sufferings of the spirit are so difficult to communicate... even to those who love you.
Do you think there's anything that has to do with you that I wouldn't understand?
I know that you're gentle and understanding, but...
I can't explain to you.
I've played with dangerous knowledge.
I've walked a strange and terrible road.
Help me to find my way back.
Oh, my sweet.
When you're all mine to love and keep...
I shall be patient as the earth with you.
Then let's not wait any longer.
Let us be married at once.
I want to with all my heart. Take me.
Take me soon.
I love you, and I want to help you.
Muriel.
I didn't expect to find you here, sir.
I've just made my profoundest apologies to Muriel.
- What about me?
- Permit me to make them to you, sir... and to trust that you will be indulgent.
You haven't explained anything yet, sir.
I was not quite myself, sir.
I was ill.
Ill?
In that case, of course, we'll say no more about it.
Thank you, sir.
May I take further advantage of your indulgence?
- Yes.
What is it?
- Your consent to our early marriage.
Please, Father.
Do say yes.
Harry needs me.
- I've already told you.
- We're too unhappy apart.
Please, Father.
This is the most important request of my life.
- I see no reason to change my mind.
- Isn't my happiness reason enough?
I assure you, sir, you will have no cause to regret it.
To be frank, Jekyll, I'm not at all satisfied with your conduct.
- I don't understand you, sir.
- I expect a man in your position... to observe certain traditions.
I want to see you more settled down before I entrust my daughter to your care.
You're too flighty, too impatient...
Believe me, these faults will be corrected.
- I give you my word of honor.
- Please, Father.
My whole life is concerned.
Please.
Well, I see you're overriding me.
Jekyll, remember you gave me your word of honor.
Yes, sir.
Very well.
You shall be married next month.
Come to dinner tomorrow and we'll make a formal announcement to our friends.
Thank you, sir.
By Jove, you've made me happy!
- I could sing or dance or roll a hoop...
- Jekyll, no.
I beg your pardon, sir.
Until tomorrow, my sweet.
- Good-bye, sir.
- Good-bye.
Poole, my dear fellow!
- I'm a very happy man!
- I'm happy to hear it!
Happy, by Jove! Happy!
"...jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops."
Yes, sir.
May I take your cape, sir?
You may, Poole. You may, my dear fellow.
I'm going to be married, Poole.
In a few weeks, she'll be under this very roof... in this very room, as my wife.
Think of it.
Think of it, Poole, and let me see your face.
Yes, sir!
I beg to congratulate you, sir!
- "If music be the food of love, play on."
- Yes.
I beg your pardon, sir... but Miss Pearson is waiting for you in the consulting room.
Miss Pearson?
The young woman as you sent the envelope to, sir.
- What does she want?
- She wishes to consult you, sir.
- Very well.
Show her in here.
- Yes, sir.
- Why, it's you, sir!
- So it is.
Now who would have thought it?
Who would have thought that I'd find the celebrated Dr. Jekyll?
- So it was you who sent me this money.
- Yes.
The minute I laid eyes on you, I knew you had a kind heart.
- But whatever made you do it, sir?
- Someone told me that you needed it.
- Who, sir?
- It doesn't matter.
The important thing is that you have it.
And you're welcome to it.
I can't take it, sir.
- Why not?
- Why?
Here's why!
Pretty, ain't it?
It's a whip, that's what it is.
Horrible!
I'll give you a lotion to soothe that.
Thank you, sir, but a lotion won't do the trick, sir.
No, sir. It's more than that, sir.
I need help, I do.
I can't stand it anymore.
- What is it, my dear?
- It's Hyde, sir.
It's him that's done that, and more as I can't tell you, sir.
He ain't human, sir. He's a beast.
He won't let me go, and I'm afraid to run away.
I've tried to drown myself, but I can't!
And if you don't help me... you as had the kindest heart in the world, sir... then give me poison so I can kill myself!
- Why didn't you go to the police?
- I was afraid.
You don't know him, sir.
He ain't a man. He's a devil.
He knows what you're thinking about.
I'm afraid of him now!
If he knows as I've been here today, I don't know what he'll do!
It won't be anything human, sir!
Save me!
Keep him off me!
I'll do anything you ask!
I'll be your slave.
Help me!
You are good, you are.
You won't let me go back to him, will you, sir?
You're an angel.
I'll do anything you like.
I ain't as bad as you think... and I ain't a bad looker, either.
I'll work for you.
I'll slave for you.
I'll love you.
You liked me once, didn't you?
Why don't you...
I give you my word that you will never be troubled with Hyde again.
No, sir!
He'll come back and kill me, sir!
He'll not come back. I'll see to it.
But you don't know him, sir.
He ain't human, he ain't.
I've given you my word, and that I never break.
You'll not see Hyde again.
Believe me.
I believe you, sir.
- You must go now.
- Yes, sir.
Begging your pardon, sir, will it be a large affair?
Not particularly.
General Carew's cronies, chiefly.
They wouldn't regard the marriage as authentic... unless it were formally announced at a dinner table, you know?
Perhaps soon you'll be giving a formal dinner yourself, sir.
I may, Poole.
- Should I call the hansom, sir?
- No, thank you.
- A walk through the park will do me good.
- Yes.
- We're early.
- I'm glad you are.
My dear, of course, I wish you all happiness.
- Thank you, Dr. Lanyon.
- How are you, General?
"Thou wast not born for death, immortal bird!"
"No hungry generations tread thee down..."
"Thou wast not born for death..."
No!
"Thou wast not born for death..."
Oh, no.
But it is dead!
Rather late.
- It's very queer, I did not hear.
- I do not understand.
Of course, he is a very busy man.
He was probably detained.
Could anything have happened to Harry, Mr. Utterson?
On a night like this, my dear?
Nonsense.
Why is he late, then?
There, my dear. It's not his lateness.
It's your impatience.
He'll be along presently.
I hope so.
Here's hoping that Hyde rots wherever he is... and burns where he ought to be.
And here's hoping that Dr. Jekyll... will think of Ivy once in a while.
He's an angel, he is.
Here's to you, my angel.
Thought I wouldn't come back, didn't you?
You took the word of that sniveling hypocrite Jekyll against mine.
Jekyll's word against Hyde's?
I know everything you do and everything you think!
You went down on your knees before him... the man I hate more than anybody in the world!
- No!
- No?
"I'll slave for you.
I'll love you.
"You're an angel, sir."
You wanted him to love you, didn't you?
I'll give you a lover now.
- His name is death!
- No! It ain't so!
Ain't it so, my little bird? My little starling.
Why, you lying wench!
You've got his money here now!
You must be the devil.
There was nobody there but me and Dr. Jekyll.
He wouldn't have told you!
No, he wouldn't!
Wouldn't he, though?
Wouldn't he?
Listen, my dear.
I'm going to let you into a secret.
A secret so great... that those who share it with me cannot live!
I am Jekyll!
I am the angel whom you wanted to slave for and love!
And I'm going to take you in my arms now and hold you close!
Close, my little lamb. My dove!
My bird!
There, my sweet.
There, my dove.
There, my little bride.
Isn't Hyde a lover after your own heart?
There's something horrible happening up there!
- Did you hear it?
- Come on.
- You murdering devil!
- Help!
Stop him!
- The monster did this.
- I know him.
His name is Hyde.
- Let me in.
I'm a friend of Dr. Jekyll's.
- He isn't at home!
I know it, you fool!
He told me to wait for him.
- You'll have to come back later!
- Open that door, or I'll break it in!
My dear, I can't tell you how sorry I am... but I hope with all my heart that Jekyll will have something to say for himself.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Lanyon.
I'll cane that scoundrel Jekyll if I ever set eyes on him again.
No, Father.
Something terrible must have happened.
I'm sure he can explain.
I believe in him.
I forbid you to see this man again.
I love him, Father, and I'm going to marry him.
Muriel, you will have nothing more to do with that man.
- Give me pencil and paper, quick.
- Yes, sir.
Hey, you. Be ready to carry a message for me.
Yes, sir.
- Hello, Briggs.
- Good evening, sir.
I beg your pardon, sir.
A messenger brought this a little while ago.
- Really?
- He said it was very important, sir.
I'm going out, Briggs, but I'll be back soon.
Yes, sir.
You may go to bed.
I won't need you any more tonight.
Thank you, sir.
- I come from Dr. Jekyll.
- Come in.
Have you got it?
Follow me.
Have you got it?
Come, sir.
You forget I have not the pleasure of your acquaintance.
I beg your pardon, Dr. Lanyon.
You know what I came for.
Dr. Jekyll sent me.
- It's important.
A package.
Is it here?
- Yes.
Here it is, but before I give it to you...
I must be assured of Dr. Jekyll's safety.
- Where is he?
- He's alive and safe.
- I'll take this to him.
- I'll go with you.
- I must see for myself that he is safe.
- That is not your concern!
I warn you not to meddle.
Take me to Dr. Jekyll, or you'll not leave this room.
I warn you, Lanyon, to let me go.
If you make another step towards that door...
- I'll shoot.
- You don't know what you're doing.
I can't tell you anything.
Ask Jekyll tomorrow.
I will be sure of Dr. Jekyll's safety, or I'll make you answer for it.
For the last time, Lanyon, will you let me go?
For the last time, no.
Very well, Lanyon.
This will be on your own head.
Now, Lanyon... will you let me take this glass and leave without further question?
I've gone too far not to see this through to the end.
Think before you decide, I tell you!
Do you want to be left as you are... or do you want your eyes and your soul to be blasted by a sight... that would stagger the devil himself?
- I'm not to be persuaded by this rigmarole.
- Very well, Lanyon.
Remember your vows to your profession.
What you are about to see is a secret you are sworn not to reveal.
You who have sneered at the miracles of science... you who have denied the power of man to look into his own soul... you who have derided your superiors.
Look!
I can't believe what I've seen.
I don't understand.
- I'm in your hands to do with as you wish.
- Horrible.
- I'm a murderer, Lanyon.
Help me.
- There is no help for you, Jekyll.
You've committed the supreme blasphemy.
I warned you... that no man could violate the traditions of his kind and not be damned.
That I still do not believe.
Don't be my inquisitor, Lanyon.
Don't judge me. Help me.
I'm at your mercy.
There is no help for you here or mercy beyond.
You're a rebel, and see what it has done for you.
You're in the power of this monster that you've created.
- I'll never take that drug again.
- Yes.
But you told me you became that monster tonight... not of your own accord.
- It will happen again. - Never.
I'm sure of it.
- I'll fight it.
I'll conquer it.
- Too late.
You cannot conquer it.
- It has conquered you.
- No. I'll fight it.
I know it will not happen again.
Help me.
You'll promise at least never to mix this drug again?
With all my heart.
And what about Muriel?
I'll give her up.
I'll go to her tomorrow.
Set her free.
Oh, God... this I did not intend.
I saw a light, but I could not see where it was leading.
I have trespassed on your domain.
I've gone further than man should go.
Forgive me.
Help me.
I beg your pardon, sir.
Dr. Jekyll is calling.
- Tell him we're not at home, Hobson.
- Father, no, for my sake.
He dares to enter this house?
Neither of us have the right to judge him.
Judge him?
Are you mad?
The fellow's a blackguard.
I won't hear you say one word against him.
- Show him in, Hobson.
- But I...
I don't know what he's done... but he's a finer and greater person than any of us.
- Silence!
I won't hear another word!
- I shall say it!
We've never understood him and never tried to understand him.
You tried to bend him to your will.
I haven't fought for him.
I don't know what's happened to him, but I know he's suffering... and it's our fault, mine more than yours.
I love him, and I'm going to help him.
This is preposterous!
I will have nothing to do with it!
I can offer you no welcome, sir.
Had the matter been left in my hands, I would have turned you from the door.
Forgive me.
Darling, are you ill?
- What is it?
- What?
What is it?
My sweet, why are you suffering so?
- Tell me what it is.
- Tell you?
I've come to tell you...
I've come to set you free.
- Set me free?
- Yes.
What are you saying?
If you ever loved me, tell me what's wrong.
Everything's wrong!
I no longer have any claim on you.
- But that's for me to say.
- No.
My darling, I beg you to tell me. What is it?
No.
You don't have to explain anything.
Whatever it is, I know you've done nothing base or mean.
Please, my dear!
Please, angel of God... don't say anymore.
I set you free.
Darling, is that all you have to say to me?
- Don't you want me any longer?
- Want you?
I want you so that I can envy the damned.
- I am damned.
- You don't know what you're saying.
Do you think I'd let you go?
Only tell me that you love me, and I'm yours.
Don't keep anything from me, darling.
- I love you, and I'll help you.
- My love.
My darling.
My beautiful... if I could take you in my arms, if I could only touch you...
Think of it.
I daren't even touch you ever again...
- in this world or the next.
- What are you hiding from me?
Trust me.
Believe in me.
I'll help you.
No.
I'm beyond help, Muriel!
I'm in hell!
- I must give you up!
- But I won't let you!
- No.
- I'll go with you wherever you say.
I'll help you no matter what it is.
If I could only have you, I'd give my soul... but I have no soul!
I'm beyond the pale!
- I'm one of the living dead!
- I won't let you go!
My poor, dear, suffering love, be quiet.
Rest.
Don't say anymore.
Be quiet and rest.
- Let me go.
Let me go quickly.
- No.
I love you.
I won't let you go.
I love you.
- Sweetheart.
- No!
I give you up because I love you so.
This is my proof.
This is my penance.
Do you hear, oh, God?
Oh, God. Don't let me.
Save me!
Help me!
Father, help!
Help, Hobson!
Help, police!
You stay here.
I'll go ahead!
This way, officer.
Stop him!
Stop him!
Help!
Police!
This is the weapon, Doctor.
I know whose cane this is.
I can take you to the man.
Break it down!
Come on, Bill. Give it a shove.
- This one's locked, too!
- Open in the name of the law!
Break it down!
- Where is he?
- He's run out there through the back door.
Come on!
- Don't stand there staring, you fool!
- Yes, sir.
The door down there is locked on the outside.
Then go out through the front.
Come on, Scobie.
- You stay there.
- Wait!
- He has escaped, sir.
- Your man has not escaped.
There!
There he is!
There's your man!
- But, Doctor, this is impossible.
- I know it is, but there's your man!
- I'm sorry, sir.
You appear to be serious...
- Look!
- Come on!
- Hold him!
Come on!
Close that door!
- Close that door there!
- Don't let him get away!
Look out!
- Steady, boy!
- Drop that knife!
Dr. Jekyll.
That's the most I got, 3,000 bottles.
You got things your own way now, Louis. Sure.
Everything is just fine. That's good.
But Pete was saying just tonight..
He say the South Side get out of line.
What are we gonna do with the South Side?
Let some of the other boys get theirs too. I got all I want.
Johnny Lovo is talking about starting something.
He's looking for trouble?
Johnny's foolish. Look at me. A man got to know whether he's got it or not.
I got plenty.
I got the house.
I got the automobile, the nice girl.
I got a stomach problem too.
- Better get some sleep. - All right.
Well, it was a pretty good party.
Next week I'll give a party which the boys have never seen nothing like it before.
Gonna have more music, much more girls, much more everything.
Everybody will say, "Ah, big Louis!"
"He sit on top of the world."
- Goodbye, Louis. - Goodbye, boys.
Take good care of yourself.
I'll see you some more.
Hello. I want Lakeside 417, please.
Yeah. 417 Lakeside. Sure.
That's a wrong number?
No, I want Lakeside 417.
Hello, Louis.
All right.
It's rotten.
"Costillo's slaying starts gang war.' That's what I want.
I'm working on that angle.
- I've got four men on it.
- Four?
You'll need 40 men on this story for the next five years.
Do you know what's happening?
This town is up for the grabs. Get me?
Costillo was the last of the old-fashioned gang leaders.
There's a new crew coming out and every guy with money for a gun is gonna try to step into his place.
You see?
They'll be shooting each other like rabbits.
For control of the booze business. Get it?
It'll be just like war.
That's it.
War.
You put that in the lead.
Gang war.
Here come the coppers.
Hello, Rinaldo. You coming along?
Where's Camonte?
- Hello, Guarino.
- Come on.
What's your hurry?
I'm getting a massage too.
We'll finish that at headquarters.
Put your coat on.
I got lots of time.
- Who wants to see me?
- The Chief.
- That kidney foot?
- Never mind the jokes.
Come on.
Hey, how's it look in the back?
Very good.
Come on, you rat.
Come on.
Tony Camonte. Aliases Gabe Rooney, Joe Black. Assault.
Carrying brass knuckles. Disturbing peace.
Street robbery on three counts. Burglary. Violation, Volstead Act.
Indicted for murder of Buck Kempner.
Member of Five Points Gang. From New York in 1920.
Present, bodyguard and strong-arm for Louis Costillo.
Bodyguard for Costillo? Pretty smart boy.
I suppose you didn't kill Louis Costillo.
Who, me?
Very funny.
Big Louis and me, we're like this.
- Can I slap it out of him?
- I'll let you have him in a while.
This fella's got ideas I don't like.
Costillo hired you for a bodyguard. Where were you?
- I was having my beauty sleep.
- Where?
In a lady's house.
You want her name?
Phone number?
She's very nice.
We'll go into your alibis later.
You've been hanging around Johnny Lovo.
Lovo split with Big Louis.
What were you doing at Lovo's house last week?
Now, listen, Tony. I'm gonna give you a chance.
Play ball with me and I'll play ball with you.
Last night, you met Johnny in Spinelli's barbershop.
What did he give you money for?
Now, listen, you.
What kind of mug do you think I am?
I don't know nothing. I don't see nothing. I don't hear nothing.
And when I do, I don't tell a cop. You understand?
- All right, Guarino. You can have him.
- Thanks. Come on, Tony.
We'll take a look at the goldfish.
Here's Epstein. Hi, boys.
Hello, Chief.
All right, let's have it.
Writ of habeas corpus for the release of Camonte and Rinaldo.
- Who gave it to you?
- Fleming.
- All right, gentlemen, see you later.
- I don't go with this guy? No.
Listen to me. You've come to town. Think you're headed somewhere.
You think you'll get there with a gun but you won't. Know why?
You've got $1,000 bills pasted across your eyes.
Some day you'll fall in the gutter.
Right where the horses have been standing, where you belong.
You've got me all figured out.
I spent my life mixing with your breed. I don't like it.
You can hide behind a lot of red tape, crooked lawyers, habeas corpus, witnesses that don't remember, but we'll get through to you like the rest.
- Maybe me, I'm different.
- No, you're not.
We'll get you in a tough spot and you'll squeal.
Like all the other rats.
Gonna get me?
In your particular case, I'd give up a month's pay for the job.
- Are you gonna see Lovo?
- Right away.
Tell him to stay undercover.
I'll come tomorrow.
- What's this writ? - Habeas corpus. "Deliver the body."
Can't hold you without booking you, no matter what.
That's a fine idea.
You tell Fleming I want lots of them.
- Come in, Tony.
Glad to see you.
Hey, that's pretty hot. - Silk.
Expensive, huh?
- I see that Epstein got to you in time.
- Nice little fella.
- He give them a writ of "hocus-pocus".
- Sit down.
He said you stay here till the heat's off.
- That's pretty hot.
- That's Poppy. Hey, Poppy.
Meet Tony Camonte.
Hi
- How are the coppers taking it?
- I didn't pay much attention.
- What about the newspapers?
- I bring them along.
The News has got the best story.
Pictures of you. - And one of me too.
- Where'd they run it, the razor ads?
Huh?
Oh, that? That's ah old business.
You'll get used to that.
- I got it in the war.
- War with a blonde in a speakeasy.
Some kidder.
It takes a long time with the pinchers?
You got an office for this sort of thing. Use it. There you are.
That's a bonus.
- That's a nice fee.
- That was a fine job.
Remember that's only chicken feed.
You stepped into big company.
You stick to me, do what I say, you'll be walking around with a gold hat.
- Do you know what I mean?
- I know.
I'm gonna cut you in on a percentage. Give you a raise.
The South Side is rolling in jack. All we do is take it.
- And have some fun with O'Hara. - Who?
Now, wait a minute.
- O'Hara's too big a guy.
- Lots of jack on the North Side. Now, listen, you.
Let me think up the ideas.
I'll take care of him when the time comes.
I say we stay out of the North Side, leave O'Hara alone.
What I say goes. Don't ever forget that.
- You're the boss.
- That's better.
From now, next to me, the boys take orders from you.
Me and you, that's fine talk, boss.
Here, have a cigar.
There'll be work for everybody.
Costillo slowed down too much.
Yeah, and now he's come to a dead stop.
Here, you'd better smoke one of mine.
That's pretty nice.
Expensive, huh?
I don't like cigar smoke in my room. Do you mind?
I'm gonna hold off that meeting with the boys.
After Big Louis' funeral is better. You know what I mean?
Yeah. Sure. It don't look so good.
I want you to send some flowers, a cross of white carnations from me.
Yeah, and I'll send a purple bunch.
Big Louis always liked purple.
Why don't you go and do it now?
You better make that meeting Monday.
Tell all the guys to be there.
Tell them I'm gonna make a speech.
Goodbye, Poppy.
See you again.
She don't like anybody but me.
She's a very busy girl.
Expensive, huh?
Here, Little Boy.
Easy dough for standing outside and listening to a gun go off?
- When will we get more?
- We get plenty.
This business is waiting for some guy to run it right.
- I got ideas.
- We're working for Lovo, ain't we?
Lovo? Who's Lovo?
Just some guy who's a bit more smart than Louis. That guy is soft.
I could just see it in his face.
He's got a set-up, that's all, and we gotta wait.
Some day, I'm gonna run the whole works.
Remember those monkeys on the North Side ain't so soft.
Say, they're satisfied, ain't they?
Why didn't they take Big Louis before we did?
Listen, Little Boy, there's only one law you gotta follow to keep out of trouble.
Do it first. Do it yourself. And keep on doing it.
- Where's Cesca?
I don't know. She go out.
What do you mean?
Ain't she coming home for dinner?
I don't like that.
Tell her to come home to dinner.
Sure, I tell her lots of times.
Come home. Tony no like.
She don't.. -
- That's a nice way to catch you.
- What do you mean?
- You was kissing him.
- What of it?
I don't like it.
I don't want anybody kissing my sister.
- Don't want anybody's hands on you.
- What are you doing?
- I'm your brother.
- You don't act it.
- You act like... Sometimes I think..
- I don't care what you think.
- Do what I say.
- I never have fun.
"Never have fun." You call that fun?
Running around with guys like that is fun?
Listen, you want the real fun?
Here. How's that?
- Gee, where'd you get it?
- Never mind.
You just spend it.
- You're swell. - Go on, get ready for dinner.
Remember, you do what I say.
No more fellas, understand?
What for you wanna give her money?
She's just a kid. She wants to have fun.
Sometimes I think you crazy.
Cesca!
- What for you take that money?
- I want it, that's why.
Give it back. It's bad money.
Tony no get it in no good way. - It's gonna bring you trouble.
- What do I care? Nothing wrong in giving it to me.
- Tony wants me to have a good time.
You listen!
Tony no love you like he make you believe.
All the time he smile on top but what he thinks...
He got a lot of tricks.
He don't give money to nobody for nothing.
- He would to his sister.
- Sister!
That make no difference.
To him, you just another girl.
Some day, when he need you, he mix you up in his business, like anyone.
And he's gonna make you bad like him.
He can't make me do anything I don't want to.
I can take care of myself.
- Yeah?
All of the time Tony say like that.
Afterwards, he no belong to me no more.
He's no good and now you start to be just like him.
No, I'm not. Don't worry about me.
I'll get along all right.
Hey.
Thank you.
That's all right, boys. Just changing the name on the door.
Meet the new president, Johnny Lovo.
Hiya, boys.
Where's Berdini, Zeigler, Meehan?
- Anybody see them?
They ain't coming.
- That all they said?
- They said, take a flying..
OK.
Now we know where they stand.
All right, guys, I'm making a speech. Here it is.
Big Louis gets a wad of dough then he gets soft.
He lets you come and run beer.
I'm gonna change it.
You can stay in but you operate the way I say.
- Are you asking us or telling us?
- I'm telling you. We're gonna get organised. It'll mean twice as much dough for everybody.
- And half as much trouble.
- You got something figured out?
Not being able to get it will make this town thirstier than ever.
Running beer is a business. I'll run it like one.
Swell.
We been cutting each other's throats long enough.
3,000 saloons on the South Side. Haifa million customers.
Add up what they pay a year for drinks. Nobody in charge.
So you're going to be it.
Yeah, "it".
That's me.
I make my own beer and I got my own trucks.
I don't have to go into business with nobody.
- Where are you going?
- Who wants to know?
You sit down here and don't interrupt the President no more.
All right, President.
Well, are the rest of you guys in or out? I'm in.
- What about Meehan?
- Yeah, Berdini and Zeigler.
They're selling to 7-800 joints between them. Yeah?
Well, from now on they're out.
- Those joints buy from us.
- Sure. Try that.
Meehan will turn this side of town into a shooting gallery. Fine.
Anything he starts, we'll finish. You don't have to worry.
- All you gotta do is to haul beer.
- Yeah?
Who's gonna stick his neck in those joints?
My friend Tony Camonte.
Yeah, I'm what you call a good salesman.
I start right now to get orders, boss?
All you can get. Go to it.
Dope, you got a pencil?
Boss, I don't write.
- That's one. - Come on.
Come on, Little Boy. Business.
What is this?
Let go of me, will you?
What do you want?
Let go!
- What's the idea?
Come on.
Say, what's the big idea?
- Who are you buying from?
- Man in Virginia.
- How many barrels a day?
- Three.
He's lying, Tony.
He's been taking five.
Chiseller! You're getting eight now and you're buying from Johnny Lovo.
But listen...
I can't use eight barrels.
I'll get you some soap. Take a bath.
- What do you pay a barrel?
- 50.
65 is better.
You get delivery tomorrow.
- What about Meehan and Berdini?
- We'll take care of them. Don't worry.
Well, that's order number one.
Now we get plenty more. There's a system to these things.
How many barrels did you say you wanted?
- Six.
- Well, you're getting ten.
You're getting a delivery tomorrow.
There's no use arguing with this joint. Zeigler runs it himself.
Step on it.
Hi, boss.
Mmm. Lots of garlic.
Get me some too.
- How's business?
More orders? - Lots.
They all buy from us.
- All we have to do is fill them.
- Better tell Meehan and Berdini.
- Them fellas retired from business.
- What have you been doing?
You said if they start something, we'll finish it?
- Well, did you?
- About an hour ago. - Hey, kid!
- Extra!
Keep the change.
Here you are, boss.
There's your South Side hailed in a box. Nailed in a...
You didn't get the lid on very tight.
- What do you mean?
- Look at that.
Come on. Hey, keep ours hot. We'll be back.
You can't come in. This is a private hospital.
You can't come in..
What did they do?
- Hi, Poppy.
- Hello.
What's all the time biting you?
You afraid of me?
That outfit is enough to give anybody the yips.
Nice, huh?
I got three more. - Different colours.
I see you're going in for jewellery.
- Kind of effeminate, isn't it?
- Yeah.
I got them in an auction.
A bargain.
You sure are a funny mixture.
- That's the first time you've smiled. - Yeah?
How do you mean I'm funny?
You just are.
What else are you doing with all your money?
I hear you're getting a new car.
It's different.
It's got bullet-proof glass and a steel body.
I got myself a new house too.
Come up sometime?
Yeah, I'll bring my grandmother.
No kidding, you'll come up?
Why don't you get yourself a girl, Tony?
- I'm working on that now.
- Yeah?
Well, don't tire yourself out.
- Johnny in?
- Yeah.
He's mad, huh?
Hi, boss.
When are you gonna learn that I am the boss?
What do you mean by breaking up that Lakeview joint last night?
- Listen, it was easy.
- It was O'Hara's place. And you know it.
I told you I wasn't ready for O'Hara.
- 50 barrels a week!
- I don't care if it's 50 a day.
Do you think with a beer keg?
We get this territory smooth and you step out.
How do you mean?
I just sell a little more beer.
- Do you know what O'Hara will do?
He'll send his guns down to the South Side.
We're liable to get it. That hop is tough.
He ain't so tough. Hanging out in a flower shop.
You afraid of a guy like that?
I ain't afraid of anybody.
- Sure you're not.
That's a crazy question, eh, Johnny?
Come on, don't argue.
- Where are you going?
- To clean up after you, you mug.
Look out!
It's Keach.
Hello? Hello?
Hello?
This is Mr. Camonte's secketary.
What's the name, please?
It's Mr. Camonte's secketary.
- Secketary, I told you. - Hey, hey, hey.
"Secretary", you dope! Secretary!
OK, boss. No, I was no talking to you.
I was talking to Mr. Camonte, my boss.
Hey.
Get a name.
What's your name?
No, no, I no wanna know what's your brother's name.
Your name. You do?
Listen, I come on over there and smack you in the teeth.
- I get you, your brother...
- That's no way to talk.
Tell him to state his business.
Go state your business!
Who was it?
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, "I don't know"?
Didn't I tell you to always get a name and write it down here?
- I forget again.
- Forget again.
- Hey, what are you writing there?
- I don't know. I can't write. Can't write?
A secretary who can't write!
A secretary must be able to write. Must be educated.
Get education. Can't write!
Education?
That's your fault.
This is Mr. Camonte's..
Oh, no, please, you are wrong.
I not hang up on you.
I thought you was through.
I told you before, you have to write a letter. You have to make...
Oh, you too, huh?
Let me tell you..
Shut up, you. What's the matter with you?
You crazy?
Listen, the last time I tell you..
You pick yourself a nice one.
- You get one for me?
- Didn't have time.
- Was there any trouble?
- No, it was easy.
- How many was there?
- He was alone.
Hey.
Hello. Who is it?
I'm so...
I don't get..
Boss, I don't get the name.
Hello?
Yeah?
Who?
Oh, sure.
Sure, send her right up.
That's Poppy.
Hey. Better nobody see you with this.
Hello, handsome.
- Well...
Poppy.
- Hello, Tony.
They tell me O'Hara was killed in his flower shop this morning.
- Had you heard that?
- Did Johnny send you up here?
Johnny?
How do you like this place?
- Kind of gaudy, isn't it?
- Ain't it?
Glad you like it. Come here.
I'll show you something nice.
Steel shutters. On all the windows.
It's my own idea.
In case you have visitors you don't like?
That's right.
How do you like the view here?
You see that?
Some day I look at that sign and say,
"OK, she's mine.'
You think so?
I got a pretty good idea.
That's pretty hot. Expensive, eh?
Come here, I'll show you something what's pretty hot.
How do you like this place?
Come here.
Here's some stuff I bought.
- Aren't they sweet?
- You like?
I'm gonna get some ties to match.
I'm gonna wear a shirt only once.
Then I give it away to the laundry.
A new shirt every day.
You're gonna drive the women mad, aren't you?
- Yeah. One of them.
- Meaning me, I suppose.
Look at this.
It's got inside springs.
I bought it in an auction.
It's a bargain.
Go on, sit down, try it.
- Yeah, it's all right.
- You like it?
I thought you were Johnny's friend.
Sure, I like Johnny. But I like you more.
Scusi, boss. - Cops is downstairs.
- Tell them to come in and sit down. I be right out.
OK.
- I don't want to be caught here.
- It's all right. Don't get excited. It's easy.
- Oh, great, thanks. - Poppy.
After I get through, I'll meet you at the restaurant at 4th Street.
- Go to the left.
- Uh-huh.
- Hello, Guarino.
- Hello.
- You all alone?
- Yeah.
You're a cute fella coming here all by yourself.
- You ain't afraid of me?
- Nor ten like you.
The Chiefs waiting.
Hey, Angelo.
Call up Epstein and tell him..
Call Epstein.
Tell him a kidney foot's taking me down to the Chiefs office.
Tell him to come right down with habeas corpus.
Hey, you know, I just heard that O'Hara met with a terrible accident.
- That's too bad.
- Yeah?
Come on.
Camonte thinks he's gonna run this side of town now he's got O'Hara.
- He's getting too big. - Yeah?
He won't get any bigger.
We'll take him before he finds out about these guns.
300 slugs a minute. Get the rest of them unpacked.
- How many we got?
- Plenty.
There's a lot more coming.
O'Hara had them run in last night.
- Got the cops on our necks.
- Forget it.
They can't do anything about it.
There's no law against bringing guns into the state.
We can buy all we want.
- What a cinch.
- You said it.
Camonte just left headquarters.
McGill's trailing him. He's gonna phone.
Hey, you guys. Load those guns.
You get the cars ready.
Stick the hearse in front of them.
Then to the South Side. I want everybody. Hang on to that phone.
Snap into it, now. Get going.
Hello, Tony.
Hello.
- Well, what took you so long?
- He was late with the habeas corpus.
Go on, order some food.
I'm hungry.
Every time I see you, you look better.
That's a cute hat.
Please, my stockings!
- What's the matter?
- Don't do that. They're brand-new.
- Hands off?
- No, feet.
You know, I know lots of girls.
Redheads and blondes, all kinds.
- They all like me.
- Yeah, you're pretty good, eh?
- I'm the best. - Are you gonna eat, by any chance?
I'm not hungry. Except for you.
- You got something I like.
- I'm nice with a lot of dressing.
- You work fast, don't you, Tony?
- I been waiting a long time.
I'm crazy for you.
Everybody says, "Tony Camonte, he's a big shot."
"He's got everything he wants."
I got everything but what I want.
You understand?
Pardon me. Telephone for Mr. Camonte.
Hey, dope. Go see who it is. And get a name.
Hello. This Mr. Camonte's secretary.
What's your name?
I say, what's your name?
This Mr. Camonte's secretary.
Speak louder. I can't hear what you're saying.
That's too loud. Talk lower.
Hello? Please?
Don't be a fool.
What's the name, please?
Again.
Hello, please?
I can't hear what you say.
Hey.
That's O'Hara's mob.
I can't hear.
I can't hear what..
Hey, look.
They got machine guns you can carry.
- If I had them, I could run the works.
- I'll get you one.
Hey, that's swell.
You can carry it.
Let's get out of here. Boss, too much noise.
I didn't get the name.
That's a dope.
Take him upstairs.
Hey, look. They've been here too.
Hey, come here. Come here.
Let's see if this works.
Hey, you. Call Foghetti. Tell him we want three cars.
Hey, Johnny. Look what I got.
Dirty, murdering mug.
You bumped off O'Hara. Who, me?
That's foolish.
You told me to stay out of the North Side.
I been home all day.
Eh, Little Boy?
Sure.
- I told you to lay off.
- I don't hear so good.
You won't be hearing anything.
Look what happened to me.
- You can carry it like a baby.
- Shut up, we gotta get organised.
- They'll be back after us.
- What?
We go after them.
- We'll show them Micks.
- Yeah?
When you're laying in an alley with your head blown off, you'll learn.
- Who's gonna do that?
- O'Hara's mob.
Gaffney.
He's running it now.
He'll put lead in your belly.
- Make sure it's him.
- Cars are here.
Little Boy, fix who goes in each car.
- Where are you going?
- The North Side.
- You can't do that.
- Who's stopping me?
- I am.
I'm giving you orders.
- Only one thing gives orders. This.
How I got the South Side and how I'll get the North Side.
Some little typewriter.
I'll write my name all over this town with it.
- Stop him, somebody.
- Out of my way, I'm gonna spit.
Come on, fellas.
Tony, take this along in case that bean-shooter doesn't work.
OK.
- See what happened here?
- I don't know, mister.
They said a big black car gave them the works.
Hello, Ben.
- What will we do about them guns?
- What can we do?
There's no law against manufacturing them, just having them.
If they can't get them in one state, they get them in another.
They better do something or what happened before will be a tea party.
I know it. Put the screws on the 22nd Street freighthouse.
I hear they're bringing them in in fruit boxes.
- Get that guy's number.
- Somebody get an ambulance.
- What is this, a pinch?
- No, just bringing you a Valentine.
- Don't you know it's Valentine's Day?
- Oh, yeah.
I forgot.
Come on, line up, you guys.
Over there. All seven of you.
- What's the gag?
Is the heat oh? - Plenty. Face the wall.
Put your mitts up. All of you.
- Here's Gaffney.
- What do you know about this? Well?
I was on my way here to keep an appointment.
I was late.
A car drives up and some guys pile out.
Two of them was cops. At least, dressed like cops.
Cops.
That's a new gag. Then what?
Well, it looked like a pinch, so I beat it till it was over.
Lucky you were late. Take a good peek and see what you missed.
Seven of them lined up against a wall.
Mowed down, just like that.
- Didn't have a chance.
- Sit down. You'll wear out the carpet.
Yeah?
I'm the only one left.
Thinks he'll get me, huh?
Fat chance.
Who's there?
- McArthur, from the Journal.
Let him in.
- Hi, Gaffney.
- How'd you find me?
We boys from the Journal always get around.
- Yeah, anybody else know I'm here?
- No, just my own little idea.
Sit down. You're gonna stay for a while.
- Well?
- Can't get a thing on him.
A blind alley wherever we go.
Gaffney turned yellow and is hiding out.
- What about Lovo?
- He's as scared as Gaffney.
It's Camonte but we can't prove it yet.
- We will.
- Say, Chief.
This fella Camonte.
A story.
The public's interested in him.
- He's a colourful character.
- Colourful?
What colour is a crawling louse?
That's the attitude of too many morons in this country.
They think these big hoodlums are some sort of demigods.
What do they do about a guy like Camonte?
Sentimentalise. Romance. Make jokes about him.
They had some excuse for glorifying our old Western bad men.
They met in the street, high noon, and waited to draw.
These things shoot a guy in the back and run away.
Colourful?
Did you read what happened the other day?
Car chasing another down the street, broad daylight.
Three kiddies on the sidewalk get lead poured in their bellies.
When I think what goes on in the minds of these lice, I wanna vomit.
Ben, see if you can find Gaffney.
He'll probably get it next.
They got all the others.
Our organisations are opposed to your policy, Mr. Garston.
Your paper could be an influence against gangsters.
Yet you keep on playing it up as front-page news.
Murders, gang war, killings.
That's all we read about.
You're glorifying the gangster by giving him this publicity.
You're trying to tell me you can get rid of the gangster by ignoring him, by keeping him off the front page.
That's ridiculous.
You're playing right into his hands.
Run him out of the country. That'll keep him off the front page.
In the meantime, you expect our children to read of outrage and murder.
That's better than their being slaughtered.
The city is full of machine guns. Gang war on the streets.
Kids aren't even safe to go to school.
- You want that to go on?
- Certainly not.
But what can private citizens do?
Even our police force can't stop it.
Don't blame the police.
They can't stop machine guns from being run across the state lines.
They can't enforce laws that don't exist.
- It's up to the federal government. - You're the government.
All of you.
Instead of trying to hide the facts, pass laws that will do good.
For instance?
A law that puts the gun in the same class as drugs and white slavery.
Put teeth in the Deportation Act.
These gangsters don't belong here. Half of them aren't even citizens.
That's true. They bring nothing but disgrace to my people.
All right, I'll tell you what to do.
Make laws and see they're obeyed, if we have to have martial law to do it.
The Governor of New Mexico declared it to stop a bullfight.
The Governor of Oklahoma to regulate oil production.
Surely gang rule and law defiance are more of a menace to the nation than the regulation of oil or a bullfight.
The army will help. So will the American Legion.
They offered their services over two years ago, and nobody ever called on them.
Let's get wise to ourselves. We're fighting organised murder.
That Sadie Thompson, she's a pretty smart girl.
Why does a girl hustle in a place like that?
Yeah, it's raining all the time.
That rain, that's pretty good.
That comes from a pipe just like a shower.
Them two fellas.
Which one do you think she'd take?
The guy with the collar?
- He ain't so hot.
- Them marines ain't so hot too.
Come on, I go take a smoke.
That's a fine show. I gotta see more shows like that.
You know, serious.
It ain't got no jokes. I like a show with jokes.
That's a dope.
What more do you want?
Listen. This girl Sadie, she's got what you call a problem.
This fella with the collar.
- What's the matter?
Spotted down Frank's Bowling Alley.
In a game.
- It's a set-up. It'd take an hour.
- I'm at a show. The last act.
There's two fellas after a girl. Her name's Sadie.
This girl Sadie, she's what you call.. disillusioned.
We gotta do it now or he might slip us again.
- He's the last one, boss.
- Come on, Tony.
That's too bad. Come on.
Wait a minute. You stay here.
Stay and see the show.
- Aw, boss.
I gotta know which fella Sadie takes.
You stay here, find out and then come tell me.
It's all right, boss.
That copper's gone.
Hey, Little Boy, you go round the back, up on the balcony.
- Hey, Pietro. - Side door. He may have friends.
Joe, the alley. If they get that far, do your stuff.
Keep the motor running. Bring the present.
You stay here.
Now we'll know what happened.
Did she take the guy with the collar?
No, she climbed back in the hay with the army.
- That's fine. She's a smart girl.
- Hey, what are you doing?
Not bad, huh?
Just watch this one.
- Hello, Tony. - How are you?
Ah! That's pretty hot.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello, stranger.
- Chair.
Well, Johnny. You're looking swell.
- I thought we'd see something of you.
- Well, here I am.
Where have you been?
On a vacation?
No, I've been working.
Up on the North Side. Eh, Johnny?
That's what the papers say.
- Don't work too hard.
- I just finished up tonight. Now I play awhile.
- You got your own table, Camonte.
- What's that?
- This is a table for two.
- Maybe you'll get another table.
Listen, you.
All right, go on.
Nothing seems to bother you much, does it?
Ah, I get used to noises.
- Hello, Guino.
- Hello, baby.
- Why do you always high-hat me?
- Go oh, beat it.
I suppose you need an organ-grinder to work with.
Tony's inside. He see you in that outfit?
I look pretty good from two storeys up.
Am I different now?
- Wanna dance with me?
- Listen, you're Tony's sister, see.
And besides, you're only a kid.
I'm 18.
Like that music?
- Now do you want to dance?
-No.
Afraid?
Afraid of Tony's sister?
Why, you..
I notice you stood there and watched.
Some day you'll find out you've been missing something.
Hey, how about it?
You and me, huh?
- I thought you weren't dancing.
- I changed my mind. I need exercise.
We'll show them something, huh?
I think you missed me, huh?
- That's right.
We'll make up for lost time.
How do you wanna play, sweetie?
That's good.
You wait here. I'll take her home myself.
- You can't.
- Shut up!
You'll be sorry for this.
Next time I catch you there, I'll kill you.
You're telling me what to do?
I'll do what I want. Understand?
- You listen to me...
- I hate you.
Never mind what I do. That's all right.
But you're gonna stay home. Understand?
I'm no baby. I can take care of myself.
Running around with fellas. Letting them hold you, look at you.
Dressing up like that for fellas to see.
What I do with fellas is my business.
Cesca?
Cesca, what's the matter?
What did Tony do to you?
He hit me. He said he'd kill me and I wasn't doing anything.
- I was only dancing.
- That's all right. No cry.
All right. Come upstairs.
No cry, baby.
He has no right to throw me around just because I'm his sister. No, no.
All right, don't cry, baby. I tell you.
I tell you lots of times.
He hurt you. He hurt you.
He hurt everybody.
Put out his tyres.
That got her.
Give us a nickel.
Lakeside 1305.
Get me a drink.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Is this Jim?
Tony Camonte. - Is Rinaldo there?
- No, he left an hour ago.
- Is Lovo there?
- Lovo? He left, too.
Said he was going to the office.
Bosworth 4503.
- Hello.
- Mabel?
Camonte.
- Rinaldo there?
- Why, no, he ain't been here. That guy is giving me the runaround.
I've had a date with him...
- Maybe he's going home to bed.
- That tomcat?
Try Maizie.
Maizie, that's right.
Uh.... Uh... Hatfield 6401.
Yeah. 6401.
Come on.
- Hello.
- Hello. Maizie?
It's Tony Camonte. - Rinaldo there?
- Yeah. For you.
- Hello.
- Hello, Rinaldo.
I'm at Pietro's. Pietro's.
- Come right away.
- Anything wrong?
Yeah, plenty.
Go get me a towel.
I thought you weren't doing anything tonight.
I'll be back later.
This is worse than being in love with a grasshopper.
- It took you a long time.
- Who done it?
I don't know, but I got an idea.
You just wait. How do you stand with Lovo?
- Come on. - How do you stand with Lovo?
- Who's Lovo?
- That's good. Say when.
That's enough.
You call Johnny Lovo at his office at ten past two, see.
Ten past two.
You say that you're calling from the country, see.
You're one of the guys that took me for a ride.
Car got smashed and I got away.
- The car got smashed and I got away.
- Yes, yes.
- You think it was Johnny?
- Don't know, but we'll find out.
We'll be there when Pietro calls.
If it was Johnny, he'll stall, won't he?
- Sure.
- Let's go.
Open the door.
Let's go.
Where you been?
What happened to you? - They spoiled my brand-new suit.
- Who, coppers?
No.
Monkeys.
Never seen them before. Somebody must've brought them in.
- How'd they get you?
- Smashed my bus. Took me for a ride.
Almost.
You left the café alone.
You ought to know better. Where were you?
I thought you always stuck to Tony.
Well, I'm glad you got away. I'd have missed you plenty.
- I'll get somebody for this.
- I knew you would.
Poppy. I don't want to see her tonight.
- I'll tell her you ain't in.
- Wait a minute. I'll talk to her.
Hello.
Who?
No, there's nobody here by that name.
What?
Ring off, you've got a wrong number.
Gonna have a drink?
You?
I didn't do it.
I wouldn't try anything on you. We're pals.
- Sure we're pals.
- No, I didn't do it. You got me wrong.
I brought you out here. You're the last guy I'd try to cross.
Don't take me. Give me a chance.
You can have anything I got. All my dough.
Poppy. I'll let you have her.
I give you my word. You can have Poppy.
The boss.
Let me go away.
I never did anything to anybody. - I haven't hurt anybody.
- No, you get somebody else to do it.
No.
Wait.
Don't.
Tony, come back.
Tony..
Tony.
What's happened?
Where's Johnny?
Where do you think?
Go pack your stuff.
Hey. Come here.
Look at that.
- Tony isn't here. He's out of town.
- You're telling me?
Why did you hang up when I called yesterday?
Too busy.
- The one on the end's kinda cute.
- She ain't bad.
I should think you'd want something more like...
Like what?
- Me.
- Cut out that sort of talk.
You're only a kid.
I told you I had grown-up ideas.
You're like Tony when you go after something, eh?
- What would Tony say?
- He'll be away for a month.
The big fella is on his way from Florida.
Uh-huh. Well, he'd better watch his step.
This town's different than when he left.
That new crowd at City Hall is looking for him.
They'll climb all over him.
Tell him to play it for what it's worth.
You stay out here.
- Where's Cesca?
- She got a place of her own. She say, "Mind your business," just like you say.
- Is she living alone?
- All the time that's what she tell me.
But I follow her.
She meet a man, they go in the house together.
I look. I see her name on the push-bell.
See what you do?
Once I have a son, I have a daughter, and now...
- Where's the place she live?
- 236 Central Street.
What you gonna do?
What go on?
No, please, no...
Stop.
Central Street.
I He was going down the grade Making 90 miles an hour
I When his whistle broke into a scream
I And they found him in the wreck With his hands on the throttle
I Scalded to death by the steam
I It's a mighty rough road From Lynchburg to Danville
I And the track's on a three-mile grade
I It was on this road that he lost his average
I You can see what a jump he made I
- Hello.
- Hello, baby.
- I'm so happy.
- You're telling me?
- You do love me, don't you?
- You know I do.
Never stop telling me, will you?
I'm not like all the others, am I?
You're up there all by yourself, sweetheart.
We'll always be happy, won't we?
Hello, Tony.
Tony,
Tony, don't..
Guino! Guino!
Guino, speak to me.
Say something. Guino!
Tony, he's my Guino.
I love him.
We married yesterday.
Really married.
We were going to surprise you.
Weren't we, Guino?
Oh, darling, please.
He's dead.
He's dead.
He loved me. Really loved me.
Don't touch me.
Don't come near me.
Stay away from me.
You're not my brother.
Don't you think I know?
Murderer.
He kills people.
He kills everybody.
He kills everything.
He's a butcher.
That's what you are.
You're a butcher.
Butcher!
Right down to the house.
Come on, boss.
Get out of here.
Come on.
Mr. Camonte's sec..
You have to speak louder.
I can't hear you.
It's...
It's Poppy, boss.
I got her name.
I didn't know.
I didn't know.
Tony, what is it?
Tony, say something. Tony..
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?
Oh, yeah? He did?
Did he get the rest of them?
Let me talk to Duffy.
Ben, here's what you've been waiting for.
Camonte killed Rinaldo.
Holed up in that steel fort of his. Get him.
Take the whole outfit. I'll send more if you heed them.
Don't lose any men.
Block off the street and smoke him out. Hello?
Send those monkeys in.
Tell Jake to stay put. Tony! - Quick, Tony.
- Cesca...
They're after you.
They're gonna get you.
Why didn't you shoot me?
Why didn't you shoot?
I don't know.
Maybe because you're me. And I'm you.
It's always been that way. You fellas go on that roof across the street.
Cover that alley at the back of the house.
Tony, what are we gonna do?
Come here, I show you what we do.
They followed me.
What's the difference, yours, mine?
You're here, that's all what matters.
- You load them. - Sure.
- I'm not afraid.
I'm like you.
- That's the way to talk.
Come on, we'll show them.
Put it here.
We'll show them.
Look at them monkeys.
They think they'll get Tony Camonte?
What did I tell you? Look, Cesca, see? Steel!
All steel! All steel.
No one can get in here.
Cesca, you and me, we'll show them. We'll lick them all.
The North Side, the South Side.
We'll lick the whole world!
Cesca!
Cesca!
Let me lie down, Tony.
I'm all hollow inside.
- Cesca, what is it? Where?
- It doesn't hurt, really.
Put your arms around me. Just for a minute.
- I won't be able to help you now.
- You can't go away. I won't let you.
So dizzy.
Hold me. - Don't let me get scared.
- I'll be here all alone.
- You can't leave me here all alone.
- Tony... - You're afraid.
Don't be afraid. - You're all I got left.
Little Boy, he's gone. Angelo, he's gone.
I'm no good without you. I'm no good with myself.
Cesca..
Cesca, they're out there.
They wanna get me.
They won't give me a chance. Please. Cesca!
Guino wasn't afraid.
Cesca, don't go. Please.
I won't let you go. You hear?
You understand? You gotta stay here.
I don't want to stay. You're afraid.
Guino. Guino..
Cesca, please!
Come back, you hear? Come back, I say.
Hurry up with that gas.
- That second window up there.
- All right.
Cesca!
Cesca!
Cesca..
I can't see.
Cesca!
Angelo!
Little Boy!
Cesca...
Cesca..
I can't see.
Get him out of there! Take it down.
Don't shoot, Guarino.
Look, I'm all alone.
I got no gun, see.
- Give me a break.
- Who did you ever give a break to?
Look, I got nobody. I'm all alone.
Little Boy is gone. Angelo is gone. I'm..
- My steel shutters don't work.
- Shut up. Come down. I'll come down.
Give me a break. Don't shoot.
You got me covered.
I can't do nothing.
Give me a break, will you?
Don't shoot, will you?
I told you I'd get you without a gun and you'd squeal like a yellow rat.
Come on. Climb into this.

In the Republic of CROGANDY...
This is radi-di-di radi-di-o Cro-gan-gandy... (stutterring...) ...your national how she is ravishing the sing-sing-singers are back for you they speak... !
That's enough.
Stop it.
In the Kingdom of Miremy...
Give this letter to the king.
Dear father,
I have had it with all of the contenders.
I will find a husband myself, a man, a chief.
The chancellor of Crogandy, for whom we boast many merits, has already won my heart.
I embrace your Majesty
I had predicted that she would fly away!
Squire!
Follow that airplane.
So long as they don't break the chancellor's head when pulling on the veil later on.
With the nose that I redid three times... and the ear that was falling off this morning.
Ah... My statue is demanding you know.
Your excellency, the author.
It is for me a great pride and it is also great honor.
But my honor is smaller than my pride.
And my pride is almost a fatherly happiness.
Madam the director, the campaign.
Go on my child, do not blunder your compliments and do not blush.
On this beautiful summer day I feel very flattered.
To offer his Excellence flowers full of eloquence.
One sharp tug and...
A speech, a speech...
Ladies and gentelmen...
Ladies and gentlemen...
My plane crashed, help me!
Go on, wake up!
What is the meaning of this?
There isn't a minute to lose, we're already late for the second ceremony.
Yes, I'm coming.
Come back! Stop!
Fire station
Attention!
To the right! Right!
To the left! Left!
At ease.
Attention!
Firefighters!
Oh my firefighters...
This day will be recorded in the annals of the country.
You must believe in yourselves!
I am well aware that you are only novices but if you have the slightest hesitation the slightest scruple the slightest emotion!
Look to me!
Look to your leader!
Attention firefighters!
Your Excellence, I bow with respect.
Captain, I thank you for receiving me with as many offferings.
Forward!
Who's foot was that?
Yes General!
- Chancellor.
Yes Captain. General.
- Chancellor. - Yes Captain. General.
- Chancellor! - Yes, yes...
What's this?
A very handsome young man.
And this one?
He's my best firefighter.
He devours fire.
Quite peculiar.
Very interesting! - He's a glutton.
Your Excellence please accept this stack at the foot of this house inflaming the courage of these rescuers that are already burning with impatience.
Bravo!
Close it! Close the gate!
Ready! Forward!
Bring it back my children!
And be gentle with it!
Foward my children! Forward!
Watch out!
Restrain him! He gonna make trouble!
A princess!
He's a chief.
His allure, his voice...
He should speak.
What is it?
Your Excellency, give the speech.
But you told me to set a fire somewhere.
The fire is out of the question, the princess demands the speech.
The speech.
On with the speech.
Gentlemen.
I have just, as you have, witnessed this terrible fire.
We all heard voices that were screaming "Help!"
"Help!"
Why I'm burning!
Help!
I'm burning!
Help!
Help!
A pose, your Excellency.
Thank you.
Help!
Help!
Bravo!
- Help!
What a man.
Help!
Hold him down well!
Hold him down well! He would eat his Excellency!
Help!
Help!
Where are you going?
Look at him, he's all wet.
It's the water from my pumps.
Not at all, if I knew who lit my backside on fire.
Now where's that miserable parade of yours?
This way, down there Admiral.
Forward mere crewman!
Princess, the Marine salutes you.
Admiral
It is with great emotion that I set foot on this platfrom.
May God bless you.
Ladies first!
Here your Excellency.
...of that sparkling wine.
You'll see what I have in store for them with this bottle.
His Majesty the King of Miremy.
Father, father.
Where am I?
You are here in a wonderful country.
Oh my head!
It's the bottle.
What bottle?
The bottle we have to break.
You want war?
Yes!
Towards the bottle!
We must save him, he'll kill himself.
That's what I was thinking.
What are you waiting for to save him?
I'm waiting on the lifesaver.
Do not fear, I am here.
I am too but I'd rather be elsewhere.
There, we're dead.
No, we're saved!
My hero.
I love you.
Sire, to you the honor.

- Hold it!
Where're you going?
- The Czechs've taken the farmstead.
- The Czechs?
Where's your rifle?
- Back there.
- Where's your rifle?
- Vassily Ivanovich, Comrade Commander,
I've lost it in the river when we fled the farmstead.
- Find it.
And where's your machine-gun, Pastukhov?
I've hidden it by the river, right on the bank.
Thank you for the farmstead, fighters.
As for your rifles, I'll personally check up on all of you tonight.
Fall out!
- My name's Furmanov.
Appointed a commissar to your division.
- I know.
That's the weavers, our volunteers.
So you're here?
Yes, we're here.
Are you a machine-gunner?
Can be a machine-gunner too.
Why?
You're just in time.
We've got an order from Mikhail Frunze:
Tomorrow we're assuming the offensive.
What are they doing there?
Taking a swim.
It's too hot.
Quiet, folks!
Chapay needs to think.
Pugachev's regiment attacks at mid- night...
Razin's stays in the reserve.
So, by 9 a.m. We'll take the village of Lomikhinskaya.
- What d'ye think, Yelan?
- I think a blow on the right flank is better.
And what does the Commissar think?
I think...
My opinion is...
The Commander's already taken the decision and I think it's right.
Everything you said here is to be spit on and forgotten.
Now listen to my command:
We attack on both flanks.
Cross the river only by the bridge. It will hold.
I've checked it.
We begin attacking at 5 a.m. Sharp.
And we'll go by way...
The village has been taken.
- Wounded?
- I am, Vassily Ivanovich.
- Stupid.
You're the only brigade commander, my military deputy.
You have no right to expose yourself to stupid bullets.
- The bullet doesn't think who's commander and who...
- It doesn't, but you must think.
Haven't you got brains?
Come here.
For example, a detachment is on the march.
Where's the commander supposed to be?
At the head, on his dashing horse.
The enemy showed up and opened cannon fire.
Where's the commander supposed to be?
He can be at the head again, because they wouldn't fire from cannons at one man.
Now the enemy opened gunfire. Where's the commander supposed to be?
Suppose they have 10 machine-guns here, and two here.
- Where The ten are.
- The ten...
Can't you think?
It's easier to kill you where the ten are. So you must be where the two are.
Otherwise, without a commander, it'll be the end of his men too.
Now the enemy is attacking. Where's the commander supposed to be?
- At the head.
- He must go to the rear of his detachment and watch the whole scene of the battle from some vantage point.
Otherwise his detachment's flanks may be turned.
Now, thanks to the decisive actions of the detachment and its commander, the enemy's been beaten off and made to flee.
Our detachment is harrying the enemy that retreats in panic.
Where's the commander supposed to be?
At the head again, on his horse.
He has to be the first to burst into town on his enemy's shoulders.
Use your brains!
You're such a liar, Vassily Ivanovich. If need be, you're always at the head.
Well, if need be.
This is called "back plate".
And this is called "cheeks".
And what's that called?
Back plate...
Cheeks...
Smart guy.
- Don't you understand jokes?
- You - are all buggers. The Chapayev men...
You're heroes only with women.
Cut it out about heroes.
Wait till I sneak to the Whites and bring back a prisoner who'll talk.
I bet I will...
We have to see about a prisoner yet. Whether you bring him or not.
You think I'm going to leave?
Forget it.
Teach me the machine-gun, you devil.
This is called "cheeks".
Cheeks!
I swear it's cheeks.
On the German front, I had the honor of fighting General von Ludendorf, and here, who the hell it is?
Chapayev!
They say he was a sergeant.
There's nothing to laugh at, Lieutenant.
Chapayev is a serious adversary.
He and his fame are equally dangerous.
Petrovich!
- Bring in The mail, please.
- Yes, Sergey Nikolayevich.
Don't you think, Colonel, that your relations with your orderly are too...
You mean, patriarchal?
Not at all.
They're quite up-to-date.
Times change - relations change.
Too bad you don't understand it.
When you attack, you look back for fear of getting a bullet from behind.
- We all should look back.
- I never do.
Petrovich's been with me since 1914, he's gone through all fronts with me.
- He's mad at us.
- He promises to shoot us.
- Who promises?
Why?
- Chapayev.
Both of us.
What for?
A fellow-villager has come to Chapayev, he was a horse-doctor there.
- So Chapayev asked us...
- He demanded!
Yes, he demanded that we put this horse-quack to a test for a doctor.
I say:
No veterinarian can test a horse-quack for a doctor.
- Chapayev got mad, called us names.
- Called us sobs.
- We know you, he says, you...
...son-of-a-bitches...
You would never let any muzhik become a doctor.
- Test him, he says, right now!
- And give him a document.
And make that document according to form, or there're 7 bullets in my gun and I'm ready to spoil two of them on you!
Aha, you're here, my dears!
Complaining! You scoundrels!
Enema injectors!
Forward march!
So you're with them?
Routing for the rotten intelligentsia?
- They can't do it...
- And I say they can!
They must!
Why won't you let a single muzhik be promoted to a doctor?
Test him at once and give him a document according to form!
You see, they can't do it. They don't have a right to.
Especially to give him a document.
How you dare mocking at Chapayev? !
I'll kill you, bastard!
Alexander the Great was a great military commander, too.
But why break stools?
Alexander the Great?
Military commander?
Who is he?
Why don't I know him?
I know all military commanders:
Garibaldi, Napoleon, Suvorov,
but this one...
Alexander... the Great?
Who is he?
Why don't I know him?
Not many people know him. He lived two thousand years ago.
But you know him, so I must know him too.
It's only two years since I've learned to read.
Come on, Commissar, tell me about this Alexander the Great.
Tell you?
Very well.
I'm a sailor, very trim and handsome, I'm only twenty years old.
Listen, sailor very trim and handsome.
I've been meaning to tell you. You should make yourself more trim.
You always look so slovenly.
You're a regular Red Army commander, you must set an example for your men.
You mean your Alexander the Great did his fighting in white gloves?
- He didn't look like a tramp.
- How d'ye know what was 2,000 years ago?
Lenin rightly said that a strong home front determines the final victory.
And in our General Headquarters, instead of strengthening this front, they're still diligently counting their chickens before they hatch.
To revive Russia...
Report.
Cossack Dmitry Potapov was arrested when trying to desert.
Yes, that's my signature.
I can't do anything about it.
Discipline.
Besides, we have a HQ directive about deserters.
An order is an order.
- Wait a minute.
This Potapov is your kin?
- My brother.
Why didn't you say it...
To subject to execution.
Chapayev's division was pushing forward...
There's unrest in the village. The 3rd Platoon men are marauding.
Go find platoon commander Zhikharev and bring him here.
You monsters!
We've been waiting for you, and you're taking our last?
- That's the Soviet power for you.
- Hush, grandma.
At wartime, even a piglet is a godsend.
You long-legged tyrant, damn you!
What's going on, damn it!
Some merry-go-round.
The Whites rob us, the Reds rob us.
What is a peasant to do?
They come here, and we shout:
"Hurray!
Hurray!" Damn them!
Are they your boys plundering in the village?
Did you let them to?
Me?
I don't know nothing about it.
Do you realize what it means?
All right, we'll talk tomorrow. And now you're under arrest.
Who's under arrest?
Me? A war commander?
This is not something to toy with. Stupid.
Arrest him.
Wait.
First issue an order, so that everything be returned.
- Where's Zhikharev?
- He's here, under arrest.
- You know Zhikharev's my comrade-in- arms?
- I know.
- And you arrest him?
How dare you?
You red-tape worm!
- And do you know that he allowed...
- Never mind what he allowed!
What he allowed, only I can forbid! You get it?
No, Comrade Division Commander!
Who's heading the division?
You or I?
You... and I.
I'm Chapayev!
Do you understand that I'm Chapayev?
And you?
Who are you?
Who sent you here?
Want to have a free ride on my fame?
Get the hell out of my division!
I don't need your fame.
As for recalling me from the division, only the Party that sent me can do it.
You're a Communist too, so you must know that.
Comrades, citizens, Red Army men, who is Chapay among you?
- I am.
- Aren't you lying?
No, I am not.
I'm him.
Then I'm here to see you.
Thank you very much.
Your boys have returned everything, to the last thing.
Otherwise it was some merry-go-round:
The Whites came and robbed us.
The Reds came and started robbing too. What is a peasant to do?
So thank you again, from all our community.
Commissar, call up a meeting, I'll be speaking.
Vassily Ivanovich, the Commissar seems to be a...
- And I thought he's a...
- You thought...
They wouldn't send some nobody to Chapayev.
What's going on, comrades?
Such a disgrace for our division! The entire Red Army's been smeared!
Who are you robbing?
You're robbing your brother, the peasant!
We're sacrificing our lives for that peasant and for the worker.
'Gainst exploitation, 'gainst all sort of capital!
Is that what the Chapayev men famous for?
Are we some bandits?
So watch out, heroes!
I'll shoot everyone who'll be caught plundering.
With this hand of mine, I'll shoot the bastard!
And if I'm caught, go ahead and shoot me!
I'm your commander only in action. When at ease, I'm your comrade.
Come to see me at midnight and later. If I'm drinking tea, join me.
If I'm having dinner, help yourself. That's a commander I am.
Am I right?
Right!
I weren't taught in academies. I ain't finished any.
Vassily Ivanovich, men are wondering. Are you a Bolshevik or a Communist?
What?
Tell me, are you for the Bolsheviks or for the Communists?
I'm for the International.
- Which one, Second or Third?
- What second?
- The International.
- I'm for the right one.
- So Which one?
- Lenin was in which one?
- The Third.
He founded it, the Third Bolshevistic.
Then I'm for the Third International, too.
That's it.
And even ahead of time.
Good for you, Anka.
You excelled in technology.
So much for the studies, Anka.
Now you're buddies with the Maxim gun.
Remember what you said about being heroes with women?
I'm going to pay a visit to the Whites.
Chapay and the commissar sent me on an important mission to get a prisoner.
- Can you?
- I can do anything.
Don't even try it!
I've taken out the charges. Drop the gun and no tricks!
Have you got many perches?
Craving for fish soup?
Some bungler.
- It's for Mit'ka...
- For whom?
- For Mit'ka...
My brother.
He's dying... he wants fish soup.
- Is he wounded or what?
- No. Lashed with ramrods.
With ramrods?
And you serve them after that?
Mit'ka's dying...
He wants fish soup...
Please let me go.
- And you let him go? - I did, Vassily Ivanovich.
- But I've got his gun.
You scatter-brain!
Under tribunal, you loafer!
Yes, under tribunal.
And you should make yourself more trim. You always look so slovenly.
What is it?
You're a soldier of the regular Red Army, my orderly.
You're supposed to set an example, and you walk about like a tramp.
Well, as I said, under tribunal!
Mit'ka's died.
My brother is dead.
Vassily Ivanovich was a peasant too. Then worked as a carpenter in Balakov.
And now he's a military commander, and what a brilliant commander!
Frunze wanted to give him an army. You and I, says he...
- Vassily Ivanovich turned him down.
- Who is it?
- Why? Let him answer first.
- Never mind.
I missed anyway.
It's good that you're not sleeping. But you shouldn't fire aimlessly.
But as long as you fire, be a good shot.
- Everything is quiet?
- Quiet, Comrade Commissar.
Hands up!
- A scout?
- No.
I've come to you.
Your boy caught me and let me go.
Now I've come on my own will.
So you're Pet'ka's White.
Your gun.
- So The offensive is planned for tomorrow?
- Yes, sir.
- You say, The officer units? Kappelev's?
- Yes, sir.
They devised some attack at the headquarters,
a psychic one...
Pet'ka, take him to the quartermaster. Keep him in the kitchen for awhile.
Come on, big guy, they almost sent me under tribunal on your account.
What does the commissar think?
They want to stop us by the counter-offensive, so they're forming a striking force.
And what does the commander think?
Don't worry, we'll meet them.
I'm going to the political department, to have a talk with the communists.
A psychic one?
Well, what the heck, let it be the psychic one.
Hey, black raven, hey, black raven,
Why you circling over me?
I shall never be your booty...
- So we're taking a battle? - We are.
Why aren't you sleeping?
So that you wouldn't say that everyone was sleeping and you fought alone.
- Did you sleep, Vassily Ivanovich?
- I did.
Go to sleep, I said!
- Was it the night before?
- Are you some inspector?
A Sleep Commissar?
I shall never be your booty, I'm not the prey of yours.
Yeah, we don't have enough ammunition.
Nor enough men.
You know, you're too awesome a man for my understanding.
I'd say you're like Napoleon!
Even more, Pet'ka, even more. Napoleon had it easier.
There were no machine-guns or air planes then. It was no big deal.
The other day they've sent me an air plane, too.
It eats so much fuel, you'd never get enough.
- Vassily Ivanovich, can you command an army?
- I can.
- How about a front?
- I can, Pet'ka, I can.
- And the Republic's armed forces?
- If they teach me a bit, I can.
Can you cope it on a world scale?
No, I can't.
I don't know foreign languages.
Will you go to sleep, you pain in the neck?
- They attack in 30 minutes.
Everyone at their places?
- Captain's not here.
I'll shoot that bastard, Zhukov.
- Pet'ka, rush to the squadron!
- Yes!
Have we got enough cartridges?
If the battle is fierce, we'll be out of them in half a hour.
Come on, cook, take it!
- Mutiny in the squadron!
They killed the commander.
- What? Zhukov killed?
- Take along some men.
- No!
I'll manage alone.
Quiet!
Don't listen to the enemy.
What are we going to win by taking our own?
There're lots of masters around. We must kill all the masters!
You can go, but don't make us go.
Enough, we've had our share of fighting. Let others fight now.
Why should we leave our homes?
Right!
We won't go.
No!
We've had enough. Let's go home, men!
Line up!
Attention!
The country's best sons are giving their lives for the cause of Revolution.
And you...
Only spilling your blood will atone for your guilt!
I will myself go at the head!
Who fired?
Who fired?
We've finished one here ourselves.
Mount horses!
- Tell me, What do men Go to their death for?
- What for?
It's simple:
For their life. Everybody wants a good life.
- That's Kappelev's officer regiment.
- Where's Chapay?
Hold on, Anka.
I'm dying. The cartridges...
- They're marching beautifully.
- Aristocrats.
Shoot, bastard, shoot!
They've sold us out, men. We're done for.
Come back!
Stop!
Cowards, abandoning your comrades!
Forward!
- Why did you stop?
Why the delay?
- Go to hell...
Cossacks!
At the Kappelev Regiment HQ...
God's with us!
Reds cowardly flee!
The Chapay men crushed like fleas!
Swell drawing!
Son-of-a-bitches!
But the verse is no good.
No, Pet'ka, put it somewhere and keep it.
- Did you call me, Vassily Ivanovich? - Yes, I did.
What's the matter, Madame?
You should have fired. Did your gun getjammed?
- No, it didn't.
- Why didn't you fire then?
- I was waiting.
- Waiting for what?
- Waiting when they get closer.
Look at her...
What a girl!
You fire very well.
Good for you!
Pet'ka, give it here.
That's for you, as a keepsake. Sit down and have some tea.
Autumn
Father wouldn't believe his son
That there's such thing as love.
A funny story.
The son took a saber, very sharp,
And he stabbed himself dead.
A funny story.
Yes, a very funny story.
Due to an emergency, I insist on Furmanov's immediate departure.
He is to be succeeded by Sedov. Frunze.
That's it, Vassily Ivanovich.
- They hurt me by this.
- They have other fronts to think of.
If it wasn't Frunze, I'd never...
This is your new commissar. You know him very well.
The disposition of the Red forces is:
HQ and Political Dept.
In Lbishchensk, the division's main forces under Yelan's command are in Sakharnaya.
As you see, the HQ remains isolated, and can be reached by the steppe.
This is our only chance to do away with Chapayev.
Yes, this is our last chance to annihilate Chapayev
and hold Lbishchensk. There's no other way.
We need a brave, determined officer to head this operation.
- To whom do you plan to entrust it?
- I would be happy if...
- You entrusted me with this operation.
- I could hope for nothing better.
I put the fate of our front in your hands.
By the way, the Allied Command valued Chapayev's head at 20,000.
The Allied Command could afford to give even more.
Behind him is the city of Guriev, and Guriev has oil.
The storm was rolling, raining hard,
The thunder roared, holding grip,
A lightning sparkled like a dart,
The tempest rolling in the deep.
The night is pitch-black, we should double the guards.
The Cossack tribe beat it as far as Guriev.
- They won't dare to come near me.
- Look, Vassily Ivanovich.
All right, tell them to put up additionalposts.
- How lucky you are!
- What?
- I say you and Pet'ka are so lucky!
- You're young, with your whole life to live.
- You're not old yourself.
Old or not, but I'm not like your Pet'ka.
You'll get married, you'll work together.
The war will be over, you'll have a beautiful life.
Do you know what life will be like?
You'll never wish to die.
No one wants to die. But our struggle is such
that we can't spare our lives. Either we win, or they win.
No, we win.
Why did you stop singing?
Come on...
Well, will I make a good performer?
Everything is quiet.
The road is clear.
Stop!
Where are you going?
Let's run to the guns!
Sakharnaya! Sakharnaya!
- They cut it, bastards!
- Ride to Sakharnaya, to Yelan!
Both of you!
Go on, I say!
I can't leave him!
And you go!
Goodbye!
- It's you?
- Me.
- That's it!
We have to retreat.
- Chapayev never retreats.
Chapayev is wounded.
Take him over the river!
Go ahead, swim. I can manage myself.
No, you won't get me!
Forward!
Fire!
The End
Do you know those Yankees actually want a war? -We'll show 'em. -Fiddle-dee-dee!
War, war, war! This war talk's spoiling all the fun at every party this spring.
I get so bored I could scream! -Besides, there isn't going to be any war. -Not gonna be any war?
Why, honey, of course there's going to be a war! If either of you says "war" just once again, I'll go in the house and slam the door.
-But, Scarlett, honey-- -Don't you want us to have a war? Well but remember I warned you.
Aren't you eating barbecue with us? I hadn't thought about that yet.
I'll think about that tomorrow.
We want all your waltzes.
First Brent, then me, then Brent, then me again and so on.
-Promise? -I'd just love to.
If only I didn't have every one of them taken already.
Why, honey, you can't do that to us.
-How about if we tell you a secret? -A secret?
Who about? Do you know Miss Melanie Hamilton from Atlanta?
Ashley Wilkes' cousin.
She's visiting the Wilkes'-- That goody-goody!
Who wants to know a secret about her? Anyway, we heard, that is, they say--
-Ashley Wilkes is gonna marry her.
-The Wilkeses always marry their cousins.
-I'll bet the other boys will be hopping mad.
We two can handle 'em!
It can't be true. Ashley loves me!
Scarlett!
What has gotten into her?
Do you suppose we made her mad?
Where're you goin' without your shawl, and the night air fixing' to set in?
How come you didn't ask them gentlemen to stay for supper?
You ain't got no more manners than a field hand after me and Miss Ellen done labored with you.
Miss Scarlett, come on in the house! Come on in before you catch your death of dampness.
No!
I'll wait for Pa to come home from the Wilkes'.
Come on in here!
Come on!
Quittin' time!
Who says it's quittin' time?
I says it's quittin' time.
I's the foreman.
I's the one that says when it's quittin' time at Tara!
Quittin' time!
Quittin' time!
There's none in the county can touch you, and none in the state.
Pa!
So it's proud of yourself, you are.
I hate her. Ashley Wilkes doesn't think so.
Ashley Wilkes couldn't like anyone like her.
What's your interest in Ashley and Miss Melanie?
Let's go into the house, Pa. Has he been trifling with you?
Has he asked you to marry him? -No! -No, nor will he.
I have it in strictest confidence from John Wilkes this afternoon Ashley is going to marry Miss Melanie.
It will be announced tomorrow night at the ball.
I don't believe it. Here! Here!
Scarlett!
What are you about?
Have you made a spectacle of yourself running after a man who's not in love with you when you might have any man in the county?
I haven't been running after him.
It's just a surprise, that's all.
Now, don't be jerking your chin at me.
If Ashley wanted to marry you, it would be with misgivings I'd say "yes".
I want my girl to be happy.
You'd not be happy with him.
I would, I would!
What difference does it make who you marry so long as he's a Southerner and thinks like you?
And when I'm gone, I'll leave Tara to you.
I don't want Tara. Plantations don't mean anything when--
You mean to tell me, Katie Scarlett O'Hara, that land doesn't mean anything to you?
Why, land is the only thing in the world worth working for worth fighting for, worth dying for, because it's the only thing that lasts.
-Oh, Pa, you talk like an Irishman.
-It's proud I am that I'm Irish.
And don't you be forgetting, Missy, that you're half Irish too.
And to anyone with a drop of Irish blood in them why, the land they live on is like their mother.
Oh, but you're just a child.
It'll come to you, this love of the land.
There's no getting away from it if you're Irish.
Yonder she comes!
Miss Scarlett, Miss Suellen, Miss Carreen, your ma's home!
Actin' like a wet nurse to them low-down, poor white trash instead of bein' here eatin' her supper.
Cookie, stir up the fire! Miss Ellen's got no business wearing' herself out.
Take the lamp out on the porch!
Wearin' herself out. Mist' Gerald, Miss Ellen's home.
Wearin' herself out waitin' on the poor white trash.
Shut up, dogs! Barkin' in the house like that.
Get up from there. Don't you hear that Miss Ellen's comin'?
Has been born and, mercifully, has died.
Goodnight, Mr. Wilkerson.
I'll fix your supper for you myself, and you eats it.
After prayers, Mammy. Yes, ma'am.
Mr. O'Hara.
You must dismiss Jonas Wilkerson.
Dismiss him, Mrs. O'Hara?
He's the best overseer in the county.
He must go tomorrow morning, first thing.
But....
-No!
-Yes.
The Yankee Wilkerson and the white-trash Slattery girl!
We'll discuss it later, Mr. O'Hara.
Yes, Mrs. O'Hara.
I want to wear Scarlett's green dress!
I don't like your tone, Suellen. Your pink gown is lovely.
-Can't I stay up for the ball tomorrow?
-But you may wear my garnets with it.
Why can't I stay up for the ball tomorrow night?
Scarlett you look tired, my dear. I'm worried about you.
Why can't I stay up for the ball tomorrow night?
I'm 13 now.
You may go to the barbecue and stay up through supper.
I didn't want to wear your tacky green dress anyhow, stingy! Oh, hush up!
Prayers, girls.
"And to all the saints, that I have sinned exceedingly in thought, word and deed...
"...through my fault.
"Through my fault, through my most grievous fault.
Blessed Michael, the Archangel...
"... Blessed John the Baptist...
"...the Holy Apostles, Peter and Paul...
"...and all the saints to pray to the Lord, our God, for me."
But Ashley doesn't know I love him!
I'll tell him that I love him and then he can't marry her!
"May the Almighty, and most merciful Lord...
"...grant us pardon, absolution...
"...and remission of our sins. Amen."
Just hold on and suck in.
I won't eat a bite. Oh, yes, ma'am, you is! You's gonna eat every mouthful of this.
No, I'm not!
Put on the dress, because we're late already. -What's my lamb gonna wear?
-That. No you ain't!
You can't show your bosom before three o'clock.
I'm gonna speak to your ma about you!
If you say one word to Mother, I won't eat a bite!
Well....
Keep your shawl on.
I ain't aiming' for you to get all freckled after the buttermilk I done put on you all this winter, bleaching' them freckles.
Now, Miss Scarlett, you come on and be good, and eat just a little, honey.
I'm going to have a good time today and do my eating at the barbecue.
If you don't care what folks says about this family, I does!
I has told you and told you that you can always tell a lady by the way she eats with folks.
Like a bird!
I ain't aiming' for you to go after Mr. Wilkes and eat like a field hand and gobble like a hog!
Fiddle-dee-dee!
What gentlemen says and what they thinks is two different things.
Now don't eat too fast. Ain't no need of havin' it come right back up again.
Why does a girl have to be so silly to catch a husband?
Scarlett, ifyou're not here by the time I count ten, we'll be goin' without you!
I'm coming, Pa!
One two, three four, five, six....
Oh, dear!
My stays are so tight I know I'll never get through the day without belching.
Well, John Wilkes.
It's a grand day you'll be having for the barbecue. So it seems, Gerald. But why isn't Mrs. O'Hara with you?
She's after settling accounts with the overseer. But she'll be along for the ball tonight. Welcome to Twelve Oaks, Mr. O'Hara.
Thank you kindly, India.
Your daughter's getting prettier every day, John.
India, here are the O'Hara girls. We must greet them.
I can't stand Scarlett. If you saw the way she throws herself at Ashley.
-Good morning. Howdy, Miss Scarlett.
Ashley!
Scarlett, my dear.
I've been looking for you everywhere.
I've got something I must tell you.
-Can't we go some place where it's quiet?
-Yes, I'd like to, but I I have something to tell you too.
Something I hope you'll be glad to hear.
But come say hello to my cousin, Melanie, first.
Oh, do we have to? She's been looking forward to seeing you again.
Melanie!
Here's Scarlett.
Scarlett!
I'm so glad to see you again.
Melanie Hamilton!
What a surprise to run into you here.
I hope you'll stay with us a few days at least.
I hope I shall stay long enough for us to become real friends, Scarlett.
I do so want us to be.
We'll keep her here, won't we, Scarlett?
We'll just have to make the biggest fuss over her, won't we?
If there's anybody knows how to give a girl a good time, it's Ashley.
Though I expect our good times will seem silly to you because you're so serious.
Oh, Scarlett, you have so much life.
I've always admired you so.
I wish I could be more like you.
You mustn't flatter me, Melanie, and say things you don't mean.
Nobody could accuse Melanie of being insincere.
Could they, my dear? Then she's not like you, is she, Ashley?
Ashley never means a word he says to any girl.
Oh, why, Charles Hamilton, you handsome old thing, you!
But, oh, Miss O'Hara, I....
Was it kind to bring your good-looking brother here just to break my poor, simple, country-girl's heart?
She never even noticed Charles before.
Because he's your beau, she's after him like a hornet.
Charles Hamilton, I want to eat barbecue with you.
Mind you, don't go philandering with any other girl, 'cause I'm mighty jealous.
I won't, Miss O'Hara!
I couldn't!
I do declare, Frank Kennedy, if you don't look dashing with that new set of whiskers!
Oh, thank you, Miss Scarlett.
Charles and Rafe asked me to eat barbecue with them but I told them I couldn't because I promised you.
You needn't be so amused.
Look at her! She's after your beau now!
Oh, that's mighty flattering of you, Miss Scarlett.
I'll see what I can do, Miss Scarlett.
What's your sister so mad about? You sparking' her beau?
As if I couldn't get a better beau than that old maid in britches.
Brent and Stuart Tarleton, you handsome old things, you!
No, you're not! I won't say that. I'm mad at you!
What have we done? You haven't been near me all day.
I wore this old dress 'cause I thought you liked it.
I was counting on eating barbecue with you two.
-Well, you are, Scarlett. -Of course, you are.
Oh, I never can make up my mind which of you two is the handsomer.
I was awake all last night trying to figure it out.
Cathleen, who's that?
Who? That man looking at us and smiling.
The nasty, dark one.
My dear, don't you know?
That's Rhett Butler.
He's from Charleston.
He has the most terrible reputation.
He looks as if, as if he knows what I look like without my shimmy!
Scarlett!
Why, my dear, he isn't received!
He spends a lot of time up North because his folks in Charleston won't even speak to him.
He was expelled from West Point, he's so fast.
And then there's that business about that girl he wouldn't marry.
Tell, tell!
Well, he took her out buggy riding in the late afternoon without a chaperon!
And then he refused to marry her!
Ashley!
Happy?
So happy!
You seem to belong here as if it had all been imagined for you.
I like to feel that I belong to the things you love. You love Twelve Oaks as I do.
Yes, Ashley.
I love it as as more than a house.
It's a whole world that wants only to be graceful and beautiful.
It's so unaware that it may not last forever.
You're afraid of what may happen if the war comes, aren't you?
But we don't have to be afraid for us.
No war can come into our world, Ashley.
Whatever comes I'll love you, just as I do now until I die.
Isn't this better than sitting at a table?
A girl hasn't got but two sides to her at a table.
I'll go get her dessert.
-Here, she said me. -Allow me, Miss O'Hara.
I think....
I think Charles Hamilton may get it.
Oh, thank you, Miss O'Hara! Thank you.
Go get it. Isn't he the luckiest...?
Miss O'Hara I love you.
I don't guess I'm as hungry as I thought.
Well-brought-up young ladies take naps at parties.
And it's high time you started behaving' and actin' like you was Miss Ellen's daughter.
When we were at Saratoga I didn't notice any Yankee girls taking naps.
No, and you ain't gonna see no Yankee girls at the ball tonight neither.
He didn't seem to be paying much attention to you. You mind your own business!
You'll be lucky not to lose ol' whisker-face Kennedy. You've liked Ashley for months!
His engagement's gonna be announced tonight.
Pa said so this morning.
That's all you know. Miss Scarlett!
If you's old enough to go to parties, you's old enough to act like ladies. Who cares!
It's time we made them understand we'll keep our slaves with or without their approval. 'Twas the sovereign right of the state of Georgia to secede from the Union! That's right!
-But, Ashley, they've insulted us! You can't mean you don't want war!
Most of the miseries of the world were caused by wars.
And when the wars were over no one ever knew what they were about.
If it wasn't that I knew you--
Now, gentlemen, Mr. Butler's been up North, I hear.
Don't you agree with us, Mr. Butler?
I think it's hard winning a war with words, gentlemen.
What do you mean, sir?
There's not a cannon factory in the whole South.
What difference does that make to a gentleman?
It'll make a great deal of difference to a great many gentlemen, sir.
Are you hinting, Mr. Butler, that the Yankees can lick us?
No, I'm not hinting.
I'm saying very plainly that the Yankees are better equipped than we.
They've got factories, shipyards, coal mines and a fleet to bottle up our harbors and starve us to death.
All we've got is cotton and slaves and arrogance. -That's Yankee treachery!
-Sir, I refuse to listen to any renegade talk!
I'm sorry if the truth offends you.
Apologies aren't enough, sir!
I hear you were turned out of West Point, Mr. Rhett Butler and you aren't received by any decent family in Charleston, not even your own!
I apologize again for all my shortcomings.
Perhaps you won't mind if I walk about and look over your place.
I seem to be spoiling everybody's brandy and cigars and dreams of victory.
That'sjust about what you could expect from somebody like Rhett Butler.
You did everything but call him out.
He refused to fight. Not quite that, Charles.
He refused to take advantage of you. Take advantage of me?
He's one of the best shots in the country as he's proved a number of times against steadier hands and cooler heads than yours.
-I'll show him! -Now, please. Don't go tweaking his nose anymore.
You may be needed for more important fighting, Charles.
Now, if you'll excuse me, Mr. Butler is our guest.
Ashley!
Ashley! Scarlett.
Who're you hiding from in here?
What are you up to?
Well, why aren't you upstairs resting with the other girls?
What is this, Scarlett?
A secret?
Oh, Ashley, Ashley I love you.
Scarlett!
Have I your heart, my darling? I love you, I love you.
Oh, I could never hate you, and I know you must care about me.
Oh, you do care, don't you?
Yes I care.
But how can we do that?
Don't you want to marry me? I'm going to marry Melanie.
But you can't. Not if you care for me.
Oh, my dear, why must you make me say things that will hurt you?
How can I make you understand?
You're so young and unthinking.
I know I love you, and I want to be your wife. You don't love Melanie.
She's like me, Scarlett.
She's part of my blood and we understand each other.
But you love me.
How could I help loving you?
You have all the passion for life that I lack.
That kind of love isn't enough for a successful marriage for two people as different as we are.
Well, why don't you say it, you coward?
You're afraid to marry me.
You'd rather live with that fool who can't speak except to say "yes" and "no" and raise a passel of mealy-mouthed brats just like her.
Who are you to tell me I mustn't?
You led me on, you made me believe you wanted to marry me.
Now, Scarlett, be fair.
I never, at any time--
You did, it's true you did!
I'll hate you till I die!
I can't think of anything bad enough to call you.
Has the war started?
Sir, you should have made your presence known.
In the middle of that beautiful love scene?
That wouldn't have been very tactful, would it?
But don't worry, your secret is safe with me.
Sir, you are no gentleman!
And you, Miss, are no lady.
Don't think I hold that against you.
Ladies have never held any charm for me. First you take a low, common advantage of me, then you insult me.
She certainly made a fool of herself running after all the men at the barbecue. That's not fair, India.
She's so attractive, the menjust naturally flock to her.
Oh, Melanie, you're just too good to be true. Didn't you see her going after your brother, Charles?
Yes, and she knows Charles belongs to me.
Oh, you're wrong, India.
Scarlett's just high-spirited and vivacious.
Men may flirt with girls like that but they don't marry them.
I think you're being very mean to her.
War!
War's declared! War!
Miss O'Hara!
Mr. Lincoln has called for soldiers, volunteers to fight against us.
Don't you men ever think of anything important?
But it's war and everybody's going off to enlist. They're going right away.
I'm going too. Everybody?
Oh, Miss O'Hara, will you be sorry?
To see us go, I mean. I'll cry into my pillow every night.
I know I couldn't hope that you could love me.
I'm so clumsy and stupid and not nearly good enough for you.
Miss O'Hara, I said, would you marry me?
Yes, Mr. Hamilton, I will. You will?
You'll marry me. You'll wait for me?
I don't think I'd want to wait.
You mean you'll marry me before I go?
Oh, Miss O'Hara.
When may I speak to your father? The sooner the better.
I'll go now. I can't wait.
Will you excuse me, dear?
Mr. O'Hara, Mr. O'Hara.
It'll be a week at least before they call on me.
Only a week, and then they'll take you away from me.
Scarlett, I thought of you at our wedding yesterday and I hoped that yours would be as beautiful, and it was.
Now we're really and truly sisters. -Charles.
-Melanie.
Miss Scarlett!
Well, I don't care.
I'm too young to be a widow. Miss Scarlett!
I don't feel anything. Why should I have to pretend and pretend....
What is it? Oh, baby....
What is it? My life is over. Nothing will ever happen to me anymore.
It's only natural to want to look young and be young when you are young.
Oh, baby....
How would you like to go visiting somewhere?
What would I do in Savannah? Well, Atlanta then.
There's lots going on there.
And you could stay with Melanie and her Aunt Pittypat.
Melanie. Yes.
Yes, I could, couldn't I?
Oh, Mother, you're sweet to me, sweeter than anybody in the world.
You'd like it, really? All right then.
Now stop your crying and smile.
Start packing Miss Scarlett's things, Mammy.
I'll go write the necessary letters.
Atlanta!
Savannah would be better for you.
You'd just get in trouble in Atlanta.
What trouble are you talking about? You know what trouble I's talkin' about. I's talkin' about Mist' Ashley Wilkes.
He'll be comin' to Atlanta when he gets his leave and you're sittin' there waitin' for him just like a spider!
-He belongs to Miss Melanie--
-You go pack my things like Mother said.
They're all whispering, and I just know it's about her.
What's it matter what they say, Aunt Pittypat?
But Scarlett is living under my roof so they all think I'm responsible for her and for a widow to appear in public at a social gathering!
Every time I think of it I feel faint!
Aunt Pitty, you know Scarlett came here only to help raise money for the cause.
It was splendid of her to make the sacrifice.
Anyone would think, to hear you talk that she came here to dance instead of to sell things.
General Lee has completely whipped the enemy.
And swept the Yankee Army northward from Virginia.
And now, a happy surprise for all of us.
We have with us tonight that most daring of all blockade-runners whose fleet schooners, slipping past the Yankee guns have brought us here the very woolens and laces we wear tonight.
Captain Butler, it's such a pleasure to see you again.
I met you last at my husband's home. That's kind of you to remember, Mrs. Wilkes.
Did you meet Captain Butler at Twelve Oaks, Scarlett?
Yes. I, I think so. Only for a moment, Mrs. Hamilton.
It was in the library. You had broken something.
Yes, Captain Butler, I remember you.
Ladies, the Confederacy asks for your jewelry on behalf of our noble cause.
Thank you.
That's a very beautiful thing to do, Mrs. Wilkes. Here.
You can have mine, too, for the cause.
And you, Mrs. Hamilton.
I know just how much that means to you.
-Melanie! -Yes, Dr. Meade.
I need your approval, as a member of the Committee for something we want to do that's rather shocking.
Will you excuse us, please?
I'll say one thing, the war makes the most peculiar widows.
I wish you'd go away.
If you had any raising you'd know I never want to see you again.
Now, why be silly?
I'll carry your guilty secret to my grave.
I guess I'd be very unpatriotic to hate one of the great heroes of the war.
I do declare I was surprised to see you turn out to be such a noble character.
I can't bear to take advantage of your little girl ideas, Miss O'Hara.
I'm neither noble nor heroic. But you are a blockade-runner.
Are you telling me you don't believe in the cause?
I believe in Rhett Butler.
He's the only cause I know.
The rest doesn't mean much to me.
And now, ladies and gentlemen I have a startling surprise for the benefit of the hospital.
Gentlemen, if you wish to lead the opening reel with the lady of your choice you must bid for her.
Caroline Meade, how can you permit your husband to conduct this this slave auction?
Dolly Merriwether, how dare you criticize me!
Melanie Wilkes told the doctor that if it's for the benefit of the cause, it's quite all right.
She did! Oh dear, oh dear. Where are my smelling salts?
I think I shall faint. Don't you dare faint, Pittypat Hamilton.
If Melanie says it's all right, it is all right.
Come, gentlemen, do I hear your bids?
Make your offers.
Don't be bashful, gentlemen.
Twenty dollars, $20 for Miss Maybelle Merriwether.
Twenty-five dollars for Miss Fanny Elsing.
Only $25 to give your-- One hundred and fifty dollars in gold.
For what lady, sir? For Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
For whom, sir?
Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
Mrs. Hamilton is in mourning, Captain Butler but I'm sure any of our Atlanta belles would be proud to--
Dr. Meade, I said Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
She will not consider it, sir.
Oh yes, I will.
Choose your partners for the Virginia reel.
We've sort of shocked the Confederacy.
It's a bit like blockade-running, isn't it?
It's worse. But I expect a very fancy profit out of it.
I don't care what you expect or what they think.
I'm going to dance and dance.
Tonight I wouldn't mind dancing with Abe Lincoln himself.
Another dance and my reputation will be lost forever.
Oh, you do talk scandalous.
You do waltz divinely, Captain Butler.
Don't start flirting with me.
He is a thoughtful gentleman.
Fiddle-dee-dee, why doesn't he say something about my sacrifice?
Oh, the darling thing.
Oh, Rhett, it's lovely, lovely.
You didn't really bring it all the way from Paris just for me.
Yes, I thought it was about time I got you out of that fake mourning.
Next trip I'll bring you some green silk for a frock to match it.
It's my duty to our brave boys at the front to keep our girls at home looking pretty.
Oh, it's so long since I've had anything new.
How do I look? Awful!
Just awful.
Why, what's the matter? This war has stopped being a joke when a girl like you doesn't know how to wear the latest fashion.
Oh, Rhett, let me do it.
But, Rhett, I don't know how I dare wear it.
You will though.
And another thing, those pantalettes.
I don't know a woman in Paris that wears pantalettes anymore. Oh, what do they...?
You shouldn't talk about such things. You little hypocrite.
I never give anything without expecting something in return.
If you think I'll marry you to pay for the bonnet, I won't.
Don't flatter yourself.
I'm not a marrying man.
Well, I won't kiss you for it either.
No, I don't think I will kiss you although you need kissing badly.
That's what's wrong with you.
You should be kissed and often.
And by someone who knows how.
Oh, and I suppose you think you're the proper person.
I might be, if the right moment ever came.
You're a conceited, black-hearted varmint, Rhett Butler.
And I don't know why I let you come and see me.
I'll tell you why, Scarlett.
Because I'm the only man over 16 and under 60 who's around to show you a good time.
But cheer up, the war can't last much longer.
Oh really, Rhett? Why?
There's a battle going on right now that ought to pretty well fix things one way or the other.
Oh, Rhett. Is Ashley in it?
Some little town in Pennsylvania called Gettysburg.
Here you is, Miss Melanie.
Yes, our boy, Darcy.
I was making these mittens for him.
He won't need them now.
I'll show 'em. I'll kill all those Yankees. Phil Meade, you hush your mouth.
Do you think it will help your mother to have you off getting shot too?
I never heard of anything so silly.
It's a black day, Scarlett.
You haven't had bad news, have you?
Ashley's safe. I'm glad, for Mrs. Wilkes' sake.
But, Rhett, there are so many others. Many of your friends? Just about every family in the county.
The South's sinking to its knees. It'll never rise again.
The cause....
The cause of living in the past is dying right in front of us.
I never heard you talk like that before. I'm angry.
Waste always makes me angry.
And that's what all this is, sheer waste. But don't you be downcast.
Ashley Wilkes is still alive to come home to the women who love him both of them.
Oh, you're here.
Oh, you're here.
You're really here at last.
Oh, my dear, I've waited so long. Melanie, my dear, my darling wife.
Oh, but we're forgetting Scarlett.
You got nobody to worry your head about leavin'.
Now you just stand still so you can be a Christmas gift for the white folks.
Now hold on.
Hold on!
Let's not talk about the war. It's Christmas.
Let's talk about Twelve Oaks, and Tara and all the times before the war. Can we have the wine, Aunt Pittypat?
Why did you say there wasn't enough, Uncle Peter?
It's the very last of my father's fine Madeira.
He got it from his uncle, Admiral Will Hamilton of Savannah who married his cousin, Jessica Carroll of Carrollton who was his second cousin once removed and a kin to the Wilkeses too.
I saved it to wish Ashley a Merry Christmas.
But you mustn't drink it all at once because it is the last.
I meant it, my dear.
It was a lovely Christmas gift.
Only generals have tunics like this, nowadays.
I'm so happy you like it, dear.
Where did you get the cloth? It was sent to me by a Charleston lady.
I nursed her son while he was in the hospital, Ashley, before he died and....
Oh, you will take good care of it, won't you?
You won't let it get torn.
Promise me. You mustn't worry.
I'll bring it back to you without any holes in it, I promise.
Good night, my dear.
Good night, Scarlett, darling.
Pretty quick now, Miss Scarlett.
She isn't going to the depot with him?
She hasn't changed her mind? No, ma'am. She's layin' down.
She's so upset Mist' Wilkes told her she can't even come downstairs.
Ashley!
Ashley, let me go to the depot with you.
Oh, Scarlett, I'd rather remember you as you are now not shivering at the depot.
Oh, Ashley, I've got a present for you, too.
While Melly was making your new tunic, I made this to go with it.
You made it yourself?
Well, then I shall value it all the more.
You know there's nothing I wouldn't do for you.
Will you look after Melanie for me?
You see, if I were killed and she-- Oh, you mustn't say that.
It's bad luck. Say a prayer quickly. You say one for me.
We shall need all our prayers now the end is coming.
The end? The end of the war.
Oh, Scarlett, my men are barefooted now and the snow in Virginia is deep.
When I see them and I see the Yankees coming and coming, always more and more....
Well, when the end does come I shall be far away.
It'll be a comfort to me to know that she has you.
You will promise, won't you?
Yes.
Is that all, Ashley?
All except, goodbye.
Oh, Ashley, I can't let you go. -You must be brave-- -No....
How else can I bear going?
Oh, Scarlett, you are so fine and strong and beautiful.
Not just your sweet face, my dear but you.
Oh, Ashley, kiss me.
Kiss me goodbye!
No, Scarlett. Oh, Ashley, I love you.
I've always loved you. I never loved anyone else.
I only married Charles just to hurt you.
Tell me you love me.
I'll live on it the rest of my life.
Goodbye.
When the war is over, Ashley. When the war is over.
And there's a place back home where a wild plum tree comes to flower in the springtime.
Since Bull Run we haven't heard anything and....
Please, we must have your temperature now.
Not just now. Melanie, I'm so tired I've gotta go home.
Aren't you tired, Melanie? No, I'm not tired, Scarlett.
And only strangers here to comfort him. No, I'm not tired, Scarlett.
They could all be Ashley.
I've been sittin' by this curb one solid hour waitin' to speak to you, Miss Wilkes.
Go on, you trash, don't you be pestering' these ladies. Don't talk to her, Melly.
It's all right, Scarlett. Who are you? My name's Belle Watlin'.
But that don't matter.
I expect you think I've got no business here.
Hadn't you best tell me what you want to see me about?
First time I come here, I says, "Belle, you're a nurse."
But the ladies didn't want my kind of nursing'.
Well, they was more than likely right. Then I tried giving' 'em money.
My money wasn't good enough for 'em, either.
I know a gentleman who says you're a human bein'.
If you are, which they ain't, you'll take my money for the hospital.
I'm a Confederate like everybody else, that's all. Of course you are.
There's some folks here wouldn't feel that way.
But maybe they ain't as good Christians as you.
Look, Mrs. Meade. It's a great deal of money.
Ten, $20, $30, $50.
And it's not our paper money. It's gold.
Let me see that handkerchief.
"R. B."
And she's driving away in Rhett Butler's carriage!
Oh, if I just wasn't a lady what wouldn't I tell that varmint!
"The Lord is my Shepherd.
I shall not want.
"He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
"He leadeth....
"He restoreth my soul.
"He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake. "Yeah, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death...
"For Thou art with me. "Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me."
Yankees! The Yankees! Dr. Meade, they're getting closer.
They'll never get into Atlanta. They'll never get through old Peg-Leg Hood. Give me something for the pain.
You've got my jack...! Give me an ace and I'll start another war!
I'll bid the moon!
That I'll never see you or Pa again.
This leg's got to come off, soldier.
No, no! Leave me alone! I'm sorry, soldier.
We're all run out of chloroform, Dr. Meade.
Then we'll have to operate without it. No, no!
Leave me alone! You can't do it.
I won't let you do it to me!
Tell Dr. Wilson to take this leg off immediately.
It's gangrene. No, no!
Don't!
I haven't seen my family in three days.
I'm going home for half an hour.
Orderly! Give me a lift.
Nurse, you can free this bed.
Miss Scarlett!
Why, Frank Kennedy!
Miss Suellen, is she well?
When did they bring you in?
-She's all right, but l-- Dr. Wilson needs you in the operating room. He's going to take off that leg.
Better hurry. I'll be back.
No, no, leave me alone!
No, no, I can't stand it!
No don't!
Don't cut!
Don't cut!
Don't, don't!
Please!
Where's the nurse?
Mrs. Hamilton, Dr. Wilson's waiting.
I don't want any more men dying!
I don't want any more!
Scarlett!
Scarlett!
Climb into this buggy.
This is no day for walking. You'll get run over.
Oh, Rhett! Drive me to Aunt Pitty's, please.
Panic's a pretty sight, isn't it?
That's just another of General Sherman's calling cards.
He'll be paying us a visit soon.
I've gotta get out of here before the Yankees come!
And leave your work at the hospital?
Or have you had enough of death and lice and men chopped up?
-With you? -Yes, ma'am.
With a man who understands you and admires you for just what you are.
I figure we belong together, being the same sort.
I've been waiting for you to grow up and get that sad-eyed Ashley out of your heart.
Well, I hear Mrs. Wilkes is going to have a baby in another month or so.
It'll be hard loving a man with a wife and baby clinging to him.
Well, here we are.
Are you going with me, or are you getting out?
I hate and despise you, Rhett Butler, and I'll hate and despise you till I die.
Oh no, you won't, Scarlett.
Not that long.
Miss Scarlett!
Miss Scarlett!
Folks is all goin' to Macon and folks is runnin' away and runnin' away.
I can't bear it!
Those cannon balls right in my ears!
I faint every time I hear one!
Uncle Peter, look out for that trunk!
But, Aunt Pitty, you aren't leaving? I may be a coward, but oh dear!
Yankees in Georgia! How did they ever get in? I'm going, too.
Prissy, go pack my things. Get them, quick! Wait, Aunt Pitty, I won't take a minute.
What is this?
You ain't planning on running away? And don't you dare try to stop me.
I'm never going back to that hospital. I've had enough of smelling death and rot and death.
I'm going home. I want my mother.
My mother needs me.
Good heavens, woman, this is war, not a garden party!
You've got to stay.
Melanie needs you. Oh, bother Melanie. She's ill already.
She shouldn't even be having a baby. She may have a difficult time.
Well, can't we take her along?
Do you want her to take that chance?
Do you want her to be jounced over rough roads and have her baby ahead of time, in a buggy? It isn't my baby!
You take care of her! Scarlett!
We haven't enough doctors much less nurses to look after a sick woman.
You've got to stay for Melanie. What for?
I don't know anything about babies being born!
I knows, I knows.
I knows how to do it. I's done it lots and lots.
Let me, Doctor, let me.
I can do everythin'. -Good.
Then I'll rely on you to help us.
-Yes, Doctor.
Ashley's fighting in the field, fighting for the cause. He may never come back.
He may die.
Scarlett, we owe him a well-born child.
Ashley.
If you're coming, Scarlett, hurry!
I promised Ashley something.
Then you'll stay?
Good.
Go along, Miss Pittypat. Scarlett's staying.
Go on, Uncle Peter.
Oh dear, I don't know what to do.
It's like the end of the world.
Uncle Peter, my smelling salts.
Melanie, it's all your fault!
I hate you, I hate you! And I hate your baby!
If only I hadn't promised Ashley!
If only I hadn't promised him!
Stop! Stop, please stop! Is it true?
We've got to before Sherman cuts the McDonough Road and catches us.
It can't be true! It can't be true!
What'll I do?
Better refugee south right quick, ma'am. If you'll excuse me, ma'am.
Prissy!
Prissy, come here!
Go pack my things and Miss Melanie's too. We're going to Tara right away. The Yankees are coming!
Yes, ma'am. Scarlett!
Scarlett! Melly, we're going to....
Melly!
It began at daybreak.
But, but....
But the Yankees are coming.
Poor Scarlett.
You'd be at Tara now with your mother, wouldn't you if it weren't for me?
Oh, Scarlett, darling you've been so good to me.
No sister could have been sweeter.
I've been lying here thinking if I should die will you take my baby?
Oh, fiddle-dee-dee, Melly.
Aren't things bad enough without you talking about dying?
-Not yet, Scarlett. I couldn't let Dr. Meade sit here for hours, while...
-...while all those poor, wounded boys-- -Melly, Prissy!
Prissy! Prissy!
Come here, quick! Go get Dr. Meade! Run quick!
Yes, ma'am. The baby!
Well, don't stand there like a scared goat. Run!
Hurry!
I'll sell you South, I will! I swear I will!
Where's that Prissy?
This room's like an oven already and it isn't noon yet.
Oh, don't worry, Melly.
Mother says it always seems like the doctor'll never come.
If I don't take a strap to that Prissy!
Oh, Melly.
You know what I heard about Maybelle Merriwether?
You remember that funny-looking beau of hers?
The one with a uniform like ladies' red flannel underdrawers.
You don't have to keep on talking for my sake, Scarlett.
I know how worried you are.
Oh, Melly, I'll just go and fetch you some cooler water.
You're as slow as molasses in January.
And where's Dr. Meade? -I ain't never seen him, Miss Scarlett.
He ain't at the hospital.
Miss Scarlett.
I's scared to go down there to the car shed.
There's folks dying' down there and I's scared of dead folks.
Oh, you go sit by Miss Melly.
And don't you be upsetting her, or I'll whip the hide off you!
-Have you seen Dr. Meade?
-One side, lady, please. Dr. Meade!
Dr. Meade! At last!
I need every pair of hands. Come, child!
Is the doctor come?
No, he can't come.
Oh, Miss Scarlett, Miss Melly bad off.
He can't come. There's nobody to come.
Prissy, you've got to manage without the doctor.
I'll help you.
Oh, lordy, Miss Scarlett.
Well, what is it?
Lordy, we've got to have a doctor.
I don't know nothin' about birthin' babies.
-What do you mean?
-I don't know-- You told me you knew everything about it.
I don't know how come I tell such a lie.
Ma ain't never let me 'round when folks was havin' them.
Don't come telling me you can't find them.
Go get them, and get them quick!
Scarlett!
Coming, Melly.
Coming.
Go, Scarlett, before the Yankees get here.
I'm not afraid. You know I won't leave you.
It's no use. I'm going to die.
Don't be a goose, Melly.
Hold on to me. Hold on to me. Talk to me, Scarlett.
Please talk to me.
Don't try to be brave, Melly.
Yell all you want to, there's nobody to hear.
Ma says that if you puts a knife under the bed it cuts the pain in two.
Cap'n Butler!
Cap'n Butler!
What do you want?
Cap'n Butler!
Oh, Cap'n Butler!
I's got a message for Cap'n Butler, Miss Watlin'!
Cap'n Butler, you come out here in the streets to me.
What is it, Prissy?
Miss Scarlett, she done sent me for you.
Miss Melly, she done had her baby today.
And a fine baby boy and Miss Scarlett and me, we brung him.
Do you mean to tell me that Scarlett--
Well, it was mostly me, Cap'n Butler, only Miss Scarlett she helped me a little, but I don't expect no doctor could have done no better!
Only Miss Melly, she feelin' kinda poorly now it's all over!
Yes, I can believe that!
And the Yankees is comin' and Miss Scarlett she said....
Oh, Cap'n Butler, the Yankees is here!
Please come and bring your carriage for us right away.
I'm sorry, Prissy, but the Army took my horse and carriage. You'd better come upstairs.
I'll see what I can do. Oh, no, Cap'n Butler!
My ma would wear me out with a cornstalk if I was to go into Miss Watlin's.
Any of you beauties know where I can steal a horse for a good cause?
-Whoa, Marse Robert.
-Is that you, Rhett? -We's here, Miss Scarlett.
We's here! -Rhett, I knew you'd come. Good evening.
Prissy tells me you're planning on taking a trip. If you make any jokes now I'll kill you! Don't tell me you're frightened.
I'm scared to death.
If you had the sense of a goat, you'd be scared too. Oh, the Yankees. No, not yet.
That's what's left of our Army, blowing up the ammunition so the Yankees won't get it.
We've got to get out of here. At your service, Madam.
Just where are you figuring on going? Home, to Tara.
Don't you know that they've been fighting all day around Tara?
Do you think you can parade through the Yankee Army with a sick woman, a baby and a simple-minded darky or do you intend leaving them behind?
They're going with me and I'm going home and you can't stop me! Don't you know it's dangerous jouncing Mrs. Wilkes over miles of open country?
Tara's probably been burned to the ground. The woods are full of stragglers from both armies.
The least they'll do is take the horse away from you and even though it isn't much of an animal I did have a lot of trouble stealing it.
I'm going home if I have to walk every step of the way.
I'll kill you if you try to stop me.
I will, I will!
I will!
All right, darling, all right.
Now you shall go home.
I guess anybody who did what you've done today can take care of Sherman.
Here, now.
Stop crying.
Now blow your nose like a good little girl.
There.
Prissy! What are you doing?
I's packin', Miss Scarlett. Stop it and come get the baby.
Yes, ma'am.
Melly!
Mrs. Wilkes, we're taking you to Tara.
Tara....
It's all right, Melly. My baby.
My poor baby.
Have you the strength to put your arms around my neck?
I think so.
Never mind.
Oh, Ashley, Charles....
What's that?
Our gallant lads must have set fire to the warehouses near the depot.
There's enough ammunition in the box cars to blow us to Tara.
We'll have to hurry to get across the tracks. -You're not going that way!
-We have to.
The McDonough Road's the only one the Yankees haven't cut yet.
I forgot to lock the front door. What are you laughing at?
At you, locking the Yankees out.
I wouldn't be in such a hurry to see them go if I were you.
With them goes the last semblance of law and order.
The scavengers aren't wasting any time.
We've got to get out of here, fast. There's a horse!
Down the alley, cut them off.
Miss Scarlett!
We'll have to make a dash for it before the fire reaches that ammunition.
Throw me your shawl.
Miss Melly done fainted way back, Cap'n Butler. Well, she's probably better off.
She couldn't stand the pain if she were conscious.
Scarlett, are you still determined to do this crazy thing?
Yes. I know we can get through, Rhett. I'm sure we can.
Not we, my dear, you. I'm leaving you here.
You're what? Rhett, where are you going? I'm going, my dear, to join the Army.
I could kill you for scaring me so!
Thinking only of your own precious hide, with never a thought for the noble cause.
Rhett, how could you do this to me and why should you go now, after it's all over and I need you?
Why? Why? Why?
Maybe it's because I've always had a weakness for lost causes once they're really lost.
Or maybe maybe I'm ashamed of myself.
Who knows?
You should die of shame to leave me here alone and helpless!
You helpless?
Heaven help the Yankees if they capture you!
Now, climb down here.
I want to say goodbye.
No! Climb down.
Oh, Rhett, please don't go. You can't leave me, please.
I'll never forgive you!
I'm not asking you to forgive me.
I'll never understand or forgive myself.
And if a bullet gets me, so help me, I'll laugh at myself for being an idiot.
But there's one thing I do know and that is that I love you, Scarlett.
In spite of you and me and the whole silly world going to pieces around us I love you because we're alike.
Bad lots, both of us.
Selfish and shrewd but able to look things in the eyes and call them by their right names.
Don't hold me like that!
Scarlett, look at me.
I love you more than I've ever loved any woman.
And I've waited longer for you than I've ever waited for any woman.
Let me alone!
Here's a soldier of the South who loves you, Scarlett wants to feel your arms around him wants to carry the memory of your kisses into battle with him.
Never mind about loving me.
You're a woman sending a soldier to his death with a beautiful memory.
Scarlett, kiss me.
Kiss me, once.
You low-down, cowardly, nasty thing, you!
They were right! Everybody was right! You aren't a gentleman!
A minor point at such a moment.
Here.
If anyone lays a hand on that nag, shoot him.
But don't make a mistake and shoot the nag.
I want you to go. I hope a cannon ball lands slap on you.
I hope you're blown into a million pieces! Never mind the rest.
I follow your general idea.
And when I'm dead on the altar of my country I hope your conscience hurts you.
Goodbye, Scarlett.
Come on, you! We're going home.
Hurry! Move, you brute!
Miss Scarlett, he's dead!
I can't see the house! ls it there?
Mother! Mother!
Pa! Mother!
Mother! Pa!
Mother, let me in. It's me, Scarlett!
I'm home!
I'm home!
Katie. Katie Scarlett.
Oh, darlin'.
-Mammy, I'm home.
-Honey, honey child!
Oh, Mammy, I'm so....
Why Miss Suellen and Miss Carreen, they was sick with the typhoid.
Just weak like little kittens.
But where's Mother?
Well Miss Ellen, she went down to nurse that Emmy Slattery, that white trash and she took down with it, too.
-And last night she....
What's this, Pa?
Whiskey? Yes, daughter.
Here, Katie Scarlett, that's enough!
You're not knowing spirits, you'll make yourself tipsy.
I hope it makes me drunk. I'd like to be drunk.
Oh, Pa.
What are those papers?
Bonds.
They're all we've saved.
All we have left.
Oh, Pa, what are we going to do with no money and nothing to eat?
We must ask your mother.
We must ask Mrs. O'Hara.
-Ask Mother? -Yes.
Mrs. O'Hara will know what's to be done.
Go out for a ride.
Oh, Pa don't worry about anything.
Katie Scarlett's home.
You needn't worry.
Miss Scarlett.
What are we gonna to do with nothin' to feed those sick folks and that child?
I don't know, Mammy.
The others went off to the war or runned away.
I can't take care of that baby and sick folks, too.
I's only got two hands.
Who's going to milk that cow, Miss Scarlett? We's houseworkers.
My back's near broken.
Look at my hands.
Mother said you could always tell a lady by her hands.
I guess things like hands and ladies don't matter so much anymore.
You rest, Sue, you're not well yet, and I can pick cotton for both of us.
Scarlett's hateful, making us work in the fields like--
Too bad about that.
Now get back to work.
I can't do everything at Tara all by myself.
What do I care about Tara?
Don't you ever dare say you hate Tara again!
The same as hating Pa and Ma.
Katie Scarlett, there's something I must speak to you about.
Yes, Pa, what is it?
I've been talking to Prissy and Mammy.
I don't like the way you're treating them.
You must be firm with inferiors but you must be gentle with them especially darkies.
Yes, Pa, I know. But I'm not asking them to do anything I'm not doing myself.
Nevertheless, Katie Scarlett, I don't like it.
What are you doing out of bed, Melly?
Scarlett, darling, I must talk to you.
You are all working so hard.
I can't lie in bed doing nothing.
Go on back upstairs.
You're as weak as a newborn colt.
Please, Scarlett, let me.
Stop being noble.
I've got enough on my hands without you making yourself sick so you'll never be any use.
Oh, I didn't think of it that way.
Who's there?
You all alone, little lady?
You ain't very friendly, are you?
You got anything else besides these earbobs?
You Yankees have been here before.
Regular little spitfire, ain't you? What have you got hidden in your hand?
Scarlett, you killed him!
I'm glad you killed him!
Scarlett!
Scarlett, what happened?
What is it, Scarlett?
Don't be scared, chickens.
Your sister was cleaning a revolver and it went off and nearly scared her to death.
Oh, thank goodness.
Haven't we got enough to frighten us? Tell Katie Scarlett she must be more careful.
What a cool liar you are, Melly.
We've got to get him out of here and bury him.
If the Yankees find him here, they'll....
I didn't see anyone else.
I think he must be a deserter.
But, even so, we've got to hide him. They might hear about it, and then they'd come and get you.
I could bury him in the arbor where the ground is soft but how will I get him out of here?
We'll both take a leg and drag him.
Do you think it would be dishonest if we went through his haversack?
I'm ashamed I didn't think of that myself.
You take the haversack, I'll search his pockets.
You look.
I'm feeling a little weak.
Melly, I think it's full of money!
Oh, Melly, look!
Look!
Ten, $20, $30, $40....
Don't stop to count it now.
We haven't got time. Do you realize this means we'll have something to eat?
Look in his other pockets.
Hurry, hurry!
-We've got to get him out of here.
If he bleeds across the yard, we can't hide it.
Give me your nightgown, Melly.
I'll wad it around his head.
Don't be silly.
I won't look at you. If I had a petticoat or pantalettes, I'd use them.
Thank heavens I'm not that modest.
Now go back to bed.
You'll be dead if you don't. I'll clean up my mess when I've buried him.
No, I'll clean it up.
Well, I guess I've done murder.
I won't think about that now.
I'll think about that tomorrow.
Katie Scarlett!
Katie Scarlett!
It's over!
It's over!
It's all over!
The war!
Lee surrendered!
-It's not possible.
-Oh, why did we ever fight? Ashley will be coming home.
Yes, Ashley'll be coming home.
We'll plant more cotton.
"While we were marching through Georgia."
Get out of the road, rebel!
Get out of the way!
Have you room in your carriage for a dyin' man? I got no room for any Southern scum, alive or dead.
Get out of the way!
I reckon he'd rather try and walk it at that.
Giddap!
Jump, you gray-backed beggars!
Act like they won the war! Now you come on and give me them pants, Mist' Kennedy.
You scrub yourself with that strong lye soap before I scrubs you myself.
I'm gonna put these britches in the boiling' pot.
The whole Confederate Army's got the same trouble crawlin' clothes and dysentery.
It's humiliating how you treat Mr. Kennedy.
You'd be a sight more humiliated if Mist' Kennedy's lice gets on you!
Come on, Beau.
We must leave this gentleman alone because he's tired and he's hungry.
I don't mind, ma'am.
Good to see a youngster again.
Nice little fellow. Another two years of war and we could have had him with us in Cobb's Legion.
Were you in Cobb's Legion?
Yes, ma'am. Why, then, you must know my husband, Major Wilkes.
Oh, yes, ma'am.
He was captured at Spottsylvania, I think.
Captured! Oh, thank heavens, then he isn't....
Oh, my poor Ashley!
ln a Yankee prison!
Melanie!
Yes, Scarlett, I'm coming.
Come along, Beau.
I'll watch out for him, ma'am.
We're good friends.
I slave day and night so we can have food to keep body and soul together.
And you give it all away to these starving scarecrows.
I'd rather a plague of locusts around here.
Don't scold me, Scarlett, please. I've just heard that Ashley was taken prisoner.
-Ashley, a prisoner!
-Yes. And maybe if he's alive and well he's on some Northern road right now.
And maybe some Northern woman is giving him a share of her dinner and helping my beloved to come back home to me.
I hope so, Melly.
Miss Scarlett, I wanted to take up something with your pa but he doesn't seem to....
Perhaps I can help you.
I'm head of the house now.
Well, I, I.... Miss Scarlett, I was aimin' to ask for Suellen.
Do you mean to tell me you haven't asked for her after all these years she's been counting on you?
Well, I, the truth is, I'm so much older than she is, and....
Well, now I haven't a cent to my name.
Who has nowadays?
Miss Scarlett, if true love carries any weight with you you can be sure your sister will be rich in that.
I'll go out somewhere and get myself a little business if we're engaged.
As soon as I get on my feet again--
All right, Frank.
I'm sure I can speak for Pa. You go ask her now.
Oh, thank you, Miss Scarlett.
Excuse me, excuse me.
Scarlett, what seems to be the trouble with Mr. Kennedy?
More trouble than he guesses.
He has finally asked for Suellen's hand.
Oh, I'm so glad. It's a pity he can't marry her now.
At least, there'd be one less mouth to feed.
Oh, another one.
I hope this one isn't hungry.
He'll be hungry. I'll tell Prissy to get an extra plate....
Ashley!
Ashley!
Darling!
Miss Scarlett!
Don't spoil it, Miss Scarlett.
Turn me loose, you fool!
Turn me loose, it's Ashley!
He's her husband, ain't he?
-Miss Scarlett, ma'am.
-High time you got back.
-Did you get the horse shod? -Yes, sir.
He shod all right.
Fine thing when a horse can get shoes and humans can't.
Here, stir this soap.
Yes, ma'am.
Miss Scarlett, ma'am. I gotta know how much money have you got left, in gold.
Ten dollars.
That won't be enough.
What in heaven's name are you talking about?
Well, Miss Scarlett, I see'd that old, no-count white-trash Wilkerson that used to be Mr. Gerald's overseer here.
He's a regular Yankee now, and he was makin' a brag that his carpetbagger friends done run the taxes way up sky-high on Tara.
But how much more have we got to pay? I hear'd the tax man say $300.
Three hundred!
Might just as well be $3 million.
But we gotta raise it, that's all.
Yes, ma'am.
I'll go ask Mr. Ashley.
Oh, he ain't got no $300, Miss Scarlett.
Well, I can ask him if I want to, can't I?
Askin' ain't gettin'.
Ashley!
They say Abe Lincoln got his start splitting rails.
Just think what I may do once I get the knack.
The Yankees want $300 more in taxes.
What shall we do?
Ashley, what's to become of us?
What becomes of people when their civilization breaks up?
Those who have brains and courage come through all right.
Those that haven't are winnowed out.
For heaven's sake, Ashley, don't stand there talking nonsense at me when it's us who are being winnowed out.
You're right, Scarlett.
Here I am talking tommy-rot about civilization when your Tara's in danger.
You've come to me for help, and I've no help to give you.
Oh, Scarlett, I I'm a coward.
You, Ashley, a coward?
What are you afraid of?
Oh, mostly of life becoming too real for me, I suppose.
Not that I mind splitting rails but I do mind very much losing the beauty of that life I loved.
If the war hadn't come, I'd have spent my life happily buried at Twelve Oaks.
But the war did come.
I saw my boyhood friends blown to bits.
I saw men crumple up in agony when I shot them.
And now I find myself in a world which for me is worse than death.
A world in which there's no place for me.
I can never make you understand because you don't know the meaning of fear.
You never mind facing realities and you never want to escape from them as I do.
Escape?
Oh, Ashley, you're wrong.
I do want to escape too.
I'm so very tired of it all.
I've struggled for food and for money.
I've weeded and hoed and picked cotton until I can't stand it another minute.
I tell you, Ashley, the South is dead.
It's dead. The Yankees and the carpetbaggers have got it and there's nothing left for us.
Oh, Ashley let's run away.
We'd go to Mexico.
They want officers in the Mexican Army.
We could be so happy there. I'd work for you, I'd do anything for you.
You know you don't love Melanie.
You told me you loved me that day at Twelve Oaks.
And anyway, Melanie can't....
Dr. Meade told me she couldn't have any more children and I could give you--
Can't we ever forget that day at Twelve Oaks?
Do you think I could ever forget it?
Have you forgotten it? Can you honestly say you don't love me?
-No.
I don't love you.
-It's a lie! Even if it is, do you think I'd leave Melanie and the baby, break Melanie's heart?
You couldn't leave your father and the girls.
I could leave them. I'm sick of them.
I'm tired of them. Yes, you're sick and tired.
That's why you're talking this way.
You've carried the load for all of us but from now on I'm going to be more help to you, I promise.
There's only one way you can help me.
Take me away. There's nothing to keep us here.
Nothing.
Nothing except honor.
Oh, please, Scarlett.
Please, dear, you mustn't cry.
You mustn't. Please, my brave dear, you mustn't plead.
You do love me, you do love me.
-Say it, say it.
-Don't, don't.
You love me, you love me.
We won't do this, I tell you.
It won't happen again. I'm going to take Melanie and the baby, and go.
Say it, you love me.
All right, I'll say it. I love your courage and your stubbornness.
So much that I could have forgotten the best wife a man ever had.
But, Scarlett, I'm not going to forget her.
Then there's nothing left for me.
Nothing to fight for.
Nothing to live for.
Yes, there is something.
Something you love better than me though you may not know it.
Tara!
Yes, I I still have this.
You needn't go.
I won't have you all starve simply because I threw myself at your head.
It won't happen again.
-Why, it's Emmy Slattery.
-Yes, ma'am, it's me.
Stop! You haven't forgotten your old overseer, have you?
Well, Emmy's Mrs. Wilkerson now.
Get off those steps, you trashy wench!
Get off this land! You can't speak that way to my wife.
Wife!
High time you made her your wife.
Who baptized your other brats after you killed my mother?
We came out here to pay a friendly call and talk a little business with old friends.
Friends! When were we ever friends with the likes of you?
Still high and mighty, ain't you?
Well, I know all about you. I know your father's turned idiot.
You can't pay your taxes.
And I come here to offer to buy the place from you to make you a right good offer.
Emmy's had a hankerin' to live here.
Get off this place, you dirty Yankee.
You high-flyin' Irish will find out who's runnin' things around here when you get sold out for taxes.
I'll buy this place lock, stock and barrel and I'll live in it.
But I'll wait for the sheriff's sale.
That's all of Tara you'll ever get!
You'll be sorry for that.
We'll be back!
I'll show you who the owner of Tara is.
Pa, come back!
Pa, come back!
Yankee coward!
Pa!
Lordsy, Miss Scarlett.
That's Mr. Gerald's watch.
You take it.
It's for you. Pa'd want you to have it.
You ain't got no business partin' from this watch now, Miss Scarlett.
You needs all your valuables to sell for that tax money.
Do you think I'd sell Pa's watch?
And don't cry.
I can stand everybody's tears but yours.
Oh, Mammy, Mammy.
You been brave so long, Miss Scarlett, you just gotta go on bein' brave.
Think about your pa like he used to be.
I can't think about Pa.
I can't think of anything but that $300.
Ain't no good thinkin' about that, Miss Scarlett.
Ain't nobody got that much money.
Nobody but Yankees and scalawags got that much money now.
Rhett!
Who that?
Oh, Mammy, I'm so thin and pale and I haven't any clothes.
Scoot up to the attic and get down Ma's old box of dress patterns.
What you up to with Miss Ellen's portieres?
You'll make me a new dress.
Not with Miss Ellen's portieres. Not while I got breath in me.
Great balls of fire!
They're my portieres now.
I'm going to Atlanta for that $300 and I've got to go looking like a queen.
-Who goin' to Atlanta with you?
-I'm going alone.
That's what you think. I's goin' to Atlanta with you.
With you and that new dress.
Now, Mammy, darling. No use to try to sweet-talk me, Miss Scarlett.
I's knowed you since I put the first pair of diapers on you.
I said I's goin' to Atlanta with you, and goin' I is.
Kings and traes, huh? Too good for me, Major!
Pity we couldn't have fought the war out in a poker game.
You'd have done better than General Grant with far less effort.
What is it, Corporal? Sir, there's a lady to see Captain Butler.
Says she's his sister.
Another sister?
This is a jail, not a harem, Captain Butler.
No, Major, she ain't one of those.
This one's got her mammy with her.
She has?
I'd like to see this one, Major, without her mammy.
Let's see, my losses for the afternoon come to what?
Three hundred and forty.
My debts do mount up, don't they, Major?
All right, Corporal.
Show Captain Butler's sister to his cell.
Thank you, Major.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
It's hard to be strict with a man who loses money so pleasantly.
-Rhett!
-Scarlett! My dear little sister.
It's all right, Corporal.
My sister has brought me no files or saws.
Can I really kiss you now?
On the forehead like a good brother.
No, thanks. I'll wait and hope for better things.
Oh, Rhett, I was so distressed when I heard you were in jail.
I simply couldn't sleep for thinking.
It's not true, they're going to hang you?
Would you be sorry?
-Oh, Rhett!
-Well, don't worry, yet.
They have plotted some charge against me but they're really after my money.
They think I made off with the Confederate Treasury.
Well, did you?
What a leading question.
But let's not talk about sordid things like money.
How good of you to come and see me.
And how pretty you look.
Oh, Rhett, how you do run on, teasing a country girl like me.
Thank heavens you're not in rags.
I'm tired of seeing women in rags.
Turn around.
Marvelous!
You look good enough to eat.
And prosperous, too. Thank you, I've been doing very well.
Everybody's doing well at Tara, only I got so bored I just thought I'd treat myself to a visit to town.
You're a heartless creature.
But that's part of your charm. You know you've got more charm than the law allows.
Now I didn't come here to talk silliness about me, Rhett.
I came because I was so miserable at the thought of you in trouble.
I was mad at you the night you left me on the road to Tara and I still haven't forgiven you.
Oh, Scarlett, don't say that.
Well, I must admit I might not be alive, now, only for you.
And when I think of myself with everything I could possibly hope for and not a care in the world, and you here in this horrid jail and not even a human jail, Rhett, a horse jail.
Oh, listen to me trying to make jokes when when I really want to cry.
In a minute I shall cry.
Scarlett, can it be possible that....
Can what be possible, Rhett?
That you've grown a woman's heart, a real woman's heart?
I have, Rhett.
You know, it's worth being in jail just to hear you say that.
It's well worth it.
You can drop the moonlight and magnolias, Scarlett.
So things have been going well at Tara, have they?
What have you done with your hands?
I went riding last week without my gloves.
These don't belong to a lady. You've worked with them like a field hand.
Why did you lie?
What are you up to?
In another minute I'd have believed you cared something.
But I do care. Suppose we get down to the truth.
You want something from me badly enough to put on quite a show in your velvets.
What is it?
I want $300 to pay the taxes on Tara.
I did lie to you when I said everything was all right.
Things are just as bad as they possibly could be.
And you've got millions, Rhett.
What collateral are you offering?
-My earbobs.
-Not interested.
-A mortgage on Tara. -What would I do with a farm?
You wouldn't lose.
I'd pay you back out of next year's cotton.
Not good enough.
Have you nothing better?
You once said you loved me.
If you still love me, Rhett....
You haven't forgotten that I'm not a marrying man.
No, I haven't forgotten.
You're not worth $300.
You'll never mean anything but misery to any man.
Go on, insult me.
I don't care what you say, only give me the money.
I won't let Tara go.
I can't let it go while there's a breath left in my body.
Oh, Rhett.
Won't you please give me the money?
I couldn't give you the money if I wanted to.
My funds are in Liverpool, not in Atlanta.
If I tried drawing a draft, the Yankees'd be on me like a duck on a June bug.
So you see, my dear, you've abased yourself to no purpose.
Here, here, here, stop it!
Want the Yankees to see you like this?
Take your hands off me, you skunk.
You knew what I was going to say before I started.
You knew you wouldn't lend me the money and yet you let me go on.
I enjoyed hearing what you had to say.
Cheer up. You can come to my hanging and I'll remember you in my will.
I'll come to your hanging.
The only thing I'm afraid of is that they won't hang you in time to pay the taxes on Tara.
Tell him Belle Watlin'.
Where you been lately?
Thought you deserted Captain Butler.
Oh, I keep myself occupied.
Help me out.
Who that?
I ain't never see'd hair that color before in my life.
Does you know a dyed-hair woman?
I wish I did know that one.
No matter what they done to you in that jail they didn't do no more than you deserve for visitin' white trash in a jail!
Fresh and green.
Right off the farm.
Hey, what are you doin' tonight, Susy?
That's one of them Georgia peaches.
There's nothing like that in Ohio.
-You know what we're going to do?
-What?
We're going to give every last one of you 40 acres and a mule!
-And a mule? -Forty acres and a mule!
Gee!
'Cause we're your friends and you're gonna become voters and you're gonna vote like your friends do!
What's your hurry, sister?
What's come over this here town?
Yankees have come over it!
Same as they've come over all of us.
Out of our way, trash!
Get out of the way here.
Get away!
Go on!
Surely it can't be Miss Scarlett!
-Why Frank Kennedy!
-And Mammy!
It sure is good to see home folks.
I didn't know you were in Atlanta.
I didn't know you were.
Didn't Miss Suellen tell you about my store?
Did she? I don't remember.
Have you a store?
Won't you come in, and look around a bit?
I don't suppose it looks like much to a lady, but I can't help being proud of it.
You're not making money?
Well, I can't complain.
In fact, I'm mighty encouraged.
Folks tell me I'm just a born merchant.
It won't be long now before Miss Suellen and I can marry.
Are you doing as well as all that?
Yes, I am, Miss Scarlett.
I'm no millionaire yet but I've cleared $1,000 already.
And lumber too.
Well that's only a sideline.
A sideline, Frank?
With all the good Georgia pine around Atlanta and all this building going on?
Well, all that takes money, Miss Scarlett and I've got to be thinking about buying a home.
What do you want a home for?
For Miss Suellen and me to set up housekeeping.
Here in Atlanta.
You'd want to bring her to Atlanta, wouldn't you?
There wouldn't be much help in that for Tara.
I don't rightly know what you mean, Miss Scarlett.
I don't mean a thing.
Frank, how'd you like to drive me out to my Aunt Pitty's?
Nothing would give me more pleasure, Miss Scarlett.
You'd better stay to supper, too.
I'm sure Aunt Pitty'd be agreeable and I'd like a good long visit with you.
Oh, you act on me just like a tonic, Miss Scarlett.
And will you tell me all the news all the news of Miss Suellen?
What's the matter, Miss Scarlett?
Miss Suellen's not ill, is she?
Oh, no, no.
I thought surely she had written you.
I guess she was ashamed to write you.
She should be ashamed.
Oh, how awful to have such a mean sister.
You must tell me, Miss Scarlett.
Don't leave me on tenterhooks.
Well, she's going to marry one of the county boys next month.
She just got tired of waiting and was afraid she'd be an old maid and....
Oh, I'm sorry to be the one to tell you.
Oh, it's colder.
I left my muff at home.
Would you mind if I put my hand in your pocket?
But, Melanie, you don't realize what she's done.
She's gone and married my Mr. Kennedy.
He's my beau, and she's gone and married him.
She did it to save Tara, you must understand that.
I hate Tara!
And I hate Scarlett!
She's the only thing I hate worse than Tara.
It's all my fault.
I should have committed highway robbery to get that tax money for you.
I couldn't let you do anything like that, and....
Well, anyway, it's done now.
Yes, it's done now.
You wouldn't let me do anything dishonorable but you'd sell yourself in marriage to a man you didn't love.
Well, at least you won't have to worry about my helplessness anymore.
What do you mean?
I'm going to New York.
I've arranged to get a position in a bank there.
But you can't do that.
I counted on you to help me start a lumber business, Ashley and, well, I counted on you.
I wouldn't be any good to you.
I don't know anything about the lumber business.
You know as much as you do about banking.
And I'd give you half the business, Ashley.
That's generous of you, Scarlett.
But it isn't that.
If I go to Atlanta and take help from you again I'd bury forever any hope of standing alone.
Oh, is that all?
Well, you could gradually buy the business and then it would be your own, and....
No, Scarlett.
Ashley....
Ashley.
Scarlett!
Scarlett, what is it?
Ashley's so mean and hateful.
What have you done?
She wanted me to go to Atlanta.
To help me start my lumber business, and he won't lift a finger to help me, and he....
Why, how unchivalrous of you.
Why, think, Ashley, think.
If it hadn't been for Scarlett, I'd have died in Atlanta.
And maybe we wouldn't have had little Beau, and and when I think of her picking cotton and plowing just to keep food in our mouths, I could just....
Oh, my darling.
All right, Melanie.
I'll go to Atlanta.
I can't fight you both.
Well, here's your new mill hands, Mrs. Kennedy.
The pick of all the best jails in Georgia.
They look pretty thin and weak to me, Gallegher.
Halt!
They're the best you can lease, ma'am.
And if you'll just give Johnny Gallegher a free hand you'll get what you want out of them.
All right, you're the foreman.
All I ask is, you keep the mill running and deliver my lumber when I want it.
Johnny Gallegher's your man, Miss.
But remember no questions and no interference.
That's a bargain. Start them in the morning, Gallegher.
Come on, get a move on!
Come on, move on there!
But, Scarlett, this isn't right and you know it.
It's bad enough for a woman to be in business, but--
What are you complaining about?
You wouldn't have owned a mill had I not taken over.
I didn't want the mill, and we couldn't have bought it if you hadn't pressed all of our friends for the money they owed me.
Isn't that right, Ashley?
What are you running, a charitable institution?
Go back to the store, then go home and take your medicine.
You're not looking very well.
But, sugar, shouldn't you come home with me?
Great balls of fire. Don't bother me anymore, and don't call me sugar!
All right, all right.
Good night, Ashley.
She can get mad quicker than any woman I ever saw.
Scarlett, I don't like to interfere, but I do wish you'd let me hire free darkies instead of using convicts.
I believe we could do better.
Darkies! Why, their pay would break us, and convicts are dirt cheap.
If we just give Gallegher a free hand--
A free hand!
You know what that means.
He'll starve them and whip them.
Some of them are sick, underfed....
Oh, Ashley, how you do run on.
Left alone, you'd be giving them chicken three times a day and tucking them to sleep with eiderdown quilts.
Scarlett, I will not make money out of the enforced labor and misery of others.
You weren't so particular about owning slaves.
That was different.
We didn't treat them that way.
Besides, I'd have freed them all when father died if the war hadn't already freed them.
Oh, I'm sorry, Ashley.
But have you forgotten what it's like without money?
I found out that money is the most important thing in the world and I don't intend ever to be without it again.
I'll make enough so the Yankees can never take Tara away from me.
I'll make it the only way I know how.
But we're not the only Southerners who have suffered.
Look at all our friends.
They're keeping their honor and their kindness, too.
And they're starving.
I've got no use for fools who won't help themselves.
I know what they're saying about me, and I don't care.
I'll make friends with the Yankee carpetbaggers.
And I'll beat them at their own game, and you'll beat them with me.
That's it.
Move it a little over to that side.
Afternoon, Mrs. Kennedy.
Good afternoon.
Business is certainly growing, ain't it?
It certainly is.
But you're doing business with the same people who robbed us and tortured us and left us to starve.
All that's past, Melly.
And I intend to make the best of things, even if they are Yankee things.
And do you know, Dolly Merriwether, that Dr. Meade actually saw her peddling lumber to those Yankees, herself.
And that isn't all....
I think it's shocking what she's doing to my brother, Ashley.
She's even taken to driving her own buggy.
My dear Mrs. Kennedy.
My very dear Mrs. Kennedy.
I don't see how you have the gall to face me.
When I think you could have had my millions if you'd just waited a little while.
Oh, how fickle is woman!
What is it you want?
I have important things to do.
Would you satisfy my curiosity on a point which has bothered me for some time?
Well, what is it?
Be quick.
Tell me, Scarlett, do you never shrink from marrying men you don't love?
How did you ever get out of jail?
Why didn't they hang you?
Oh, that! Not much trouble.
There's nothing much that money won't buy.
I observe it's even bought you the honorable Mr. Wilkes.
So you still hate Ashley Wilkes.
Do you know, I believe you're jealous of him.
You still think you're the belle of the county, don't you?
That you're the cutest little trick in shoe leather.
And that every man you meet is dying of love for you.
Let me by!
Don't be angry, Scarlett.
Tell me, where are you going?
To the mill, if it's any of your business.
Through shantytown, alone?
Haven't you been told it's dangerous to drive alone through all that riffraff?
Don't worry about me.
I can shoot straight if I don't have to shoot too far.
What a woman!
Could ya gimme a quarter?
Let go of my horse!
Hold this horse!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Miss Scarlett!
Miss Scarlett, wait!
Miss Scarlett!
Miss Scarlett!
It's Big Sam!
Big Sam!
Miss Scarlett!
Wait!
Sam!
Sam!
Is you hurt, Miss Scarlett?
Did they hurt you?
Don't you cry, Miss Scarlett.
Big Sam'll get you out of this in a jiffy.
Horse, make tracks!
You get to Tara just as quick as you can, and stay there.
I sure will.
I's got enough of them carpetbaggers.
Thank you, Mr. Frank.
Goodbye, Miss Scarlett.
Goodbye, Sam, and thank you.
Scarlett, change your dress and go over to Miss Melly's for the evening.
I've got to go to a political meeting.
A political meeting!
How can you go to a political meeting after what I've been through this afternoon?
Oh, sugar!
You're more scared than hurt.
Nobody cares about me.
You all act as though it was nothing at all.
The men talk, talk, talk about protecting our women and after what happened to me today Frank has to go to a political meeting.
And if it won't pain you too much, India Wilkes I'd be much obliged if you'll tell me why you're staring at me.
Has my face gone green or something?
It won't pain me!
What happened this afternoon was just what you deserved!
And if there was any justice, you'd have gotten worse.
India, hush up!
Let her talk, Melanie.
She's always hated me!
Ever since I took your brother away from her though she's too much of a hypocrite to admit it!
If she thought anyone'd go for her she'd walk down the street naked!
I do hate you!
You've done all you could to lower the prestige of decent people.
Now you've endangered the lives of our men, because they--
India!
I don't think we'd better say any more, or one of us will be saying too much.
What's going on around here that I don't know about?
Somebody's comin' up the walk.
Somebody that ain't Mr. Ashley.
Will you hand me the pistol, please, Mrs. Meade?
Whoever it is we know nothing.
Where have they gone?
You've got to tell me, Mrs. Wilkes.
It's life or death!
Don't tell him anything.
He's a Yankee spy.
Quickly, please!
There may still be time.
How did you know?
I've been playing poker with two Yankee captains.
They knew there'd be trouble tonight.
They've sent their cavalry out to be ready for it.
Your husband and his friends are walking into a trap.
Don't tell him!
He's trying to trap you!
Out the Decatur Road.
The old Sullivan plantation.
The house is burned.
They're meeting in the cellar.
I'll do what I can.
What's all this about?
If you don't tell me, I'll go crazy!
We thought it best not to tell you, Scarlett.
But Ashley and Frank and the others have gone to clean out those woods where you were attacked.
It's what a great many of our Southern gentlemen have had to do lately for our protection.
And if they're captured, they'll be hanged, Scarlett!
And it will be your fault!
Another word, and you go out of this house, India!
Scarlett did what she thought she had to do.
And our men are doing what they think they have to do.
Frank!
And Ashley!
Oh, it isn't possible!
There's horses, Miss Melly.
Here they come.
You're sewing, you're sewing.
Open the door, Mammy.
Good evening, Mrs. Kennedy.
Which of you ladies is Mrs. Wilkes?
I am Mrs. Wilkes.
I should like to speak to Mr. Wilkes, if you please.
He's not here.
Are you sure?
Don't you doubt Miss Melly's word.
I meant no disrespect, Mrs. Wilkes.
If you'll give me your word, I won't search the house.
Search if you like, but Mr. Wilkes is at a political meeting at Mr. Kennedy's store.
He's not at the store, and there's no meeting tonight!
No political meeting.
We'll wait outside till he and his friends return.
Sergeant, surround the house.
Put a man on each door and window.
Yes, sir!
Keep on with your sewing, ladies.
And I'll read aloud.
"The Personal History and Experience of David Copperfield.
"Chapter one.
"l'm born.
"To begin my life, with the beginning of my life, I record that I was born.
"Chapter Nine.
I have a memorable birthday.
"l pass over all that happened at school...
"...until the anniversary of my birthday came around in March.
"Except that Steerforth was more to be admired than ever.
"l remember nothing.
"He was going away at the end of the half year, if not sooner...
"...and was more spirited and independent than before in my eyes...
"...and, therefore, more engaging than before, but...
"...beyond this I remember nothing.
"The great...."
"l remember nothing."
Melly!
They're drunk!
Leave this to me, Scarlett.
And, please, say nothing.
You stupid fool!
Quiet!
Will you shut up for the love of...?
Hello, Melly.
So, you've got my husband intoxicated again, Captain Butler!
Well, bring him in.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Wilkes.
Your husband's under arrest.
If you arrest all the men who get intoxicated you must have a good many Yankees in jail.
Bring him in, Captain Butler.
If you can walk yourself.
I want to tell you a story....
Listen, Doctor, I....
Put him there in that chair.
And now, Captain Butler, will you please leave my house and try to remember not to come here again?
Well, now that's fine thanks I get for bringing him home and not leaving him on the streets in this shameful condition!
Now, boys, all together!
Dr. Meade I'm astonished at you!
Oh, Ashley!
How can you do this to me?
I ain't so very drunk, Melly.
Take him into the bedroom and lay him out on the bed as usual.
Don't touch him, he's under arrest!
Now, Tom.
What do you want to arrest him for?
I've seen him drunker.
I've seen you drunker!
And you've seen me....
He can lie in the gutter for all I care!
I'm not a policeman.
But he led a raid tonight on that shantytown where Mrs. Kennedy got into trouble this afternoon.
A lot of those shanties were burned.
A couple of men were killed.
It's about time you rebels learned you can't take the law into your own hands.
What are you laughing at?
This isn't your night to teach that lesson, Tom.
These two have been with me tonight.
Yes, sir.
With you, Rhett?
Where?
I don't like to say in the presence of ladies.
You'd better say.
Come out on the porch and I'll tell you.
Speak out, Captain Butler!
I think I have a right to know where my husband's been.
Well, ma'am, we dropped in on a friend of mine and the captain's.
A Mrs. Belle Watling.
We played cards, drank champagne and well....
Now, you've done it!
Did you have to show me up in front of my wife?
Now I hope you're satisfied, Tom.
These ladies won't be on speaking terms with their husbands tomorrow.
Rhett, I had no idea, I....
Look here, will you take an oath that they were with you tonight at at Belle's?
Ask Belle, if you don't believe me.
She'll tell you, Captain.
Will you give me your word as a gentleman?
As a gentleman?
Why certainly, Tom.
Well, if I if I've made a mistake, I'm sorry.
I hope you'll forgive me, Mrs. Wilkes. I....
If you'll go and leave us in peace, please.
Well, I say I'm sorry, and well, I am sorry.
Come on, Sergeant.
Lock that door.
Pull down the shades.
Ashley.
It's all right.
It's only in the shoulder.
Get him on the bed where I can dress the wound.
I think I can walk.
It's not worth the effort.
Which way?
In here.
-Mammy, I want some hot water.
-Yes, sir.
-And lint for bandages. -I'll find some.
Now what can I use for a probe?
If I only had my bag.
Were you really there?
What did it look like?
Does she have cut-glass chandeliers, plush curtains and dozens of mirrors?
Good heavens, Mrs. Meade, remember yourself.
And now, Captain Butler, tell me what happened, all that happened.
I was too late.
When I got to the old Sullivan place there'd already been a skirmish with the Yankees.
I found Mr. Wilkes wounded and Dr. Meade was with him.
I had to prove they had been somewhere, anyplace but where they were.
So I took them to Belle's.
And she took them in?
She's by way of being an old friend of mine.
Oh, I'm sorry. I--
I'm sorry I couldn't think up a more dignified alibi.
This isn't the first time you've come between me and disaster, Captain Butler.
It isn't likely that I'd question any device of yours.
And now, I'll go and see what Dr. Meade needs.
Oh, Ashley!
Ashley!
Have you no interest in what's become of your own husband, Mrs. Kennedy?
Did Frank go with you to Belle Watling's?
No.
Well, where is he?
He's lying out on Decatur Road shot through the head.
He's dead.
Who is it?
It's Miss Watlin'.
Oh, Mrs. Watling!
Won't you come in the house?
Oh, no, I couldn't do that, Miss Wilkes.
You come in and sit a minute with me.
How can I thank you enough for what you did for us?
How can any of us thank you enough?
I got your note sayin' you was goin' to call on me and thank me.
Why, Miss Wilkes, you must have lost your mind.
I come up here as soon as it was dark to tell you you mustn't even think of any such thing.
Why, I'm....
Why, you're....
Well, it wouldn't be fitting' at all.
It wouldn't be fitting to thank a kind woman who saved my husband's life?
Miss Wilkes, there ain't never been a lady in this town nice to me like you was.
I mean, about the money for the hospital, you know.
And I don't forget a kindness.
And I got to thinking about you being left a widow with a little boy if Mr. Wilkes got hung and he's a nice little boy, your boy is, Miss Wilkes.
I got a boy myself and so I....
Oh, you have?
Does he live...?
Oh, no, ma'am, he ain't here in Atlanta.
He ain't never been here.
He's off at school.
I ain't seen him since he was little.
Well, anyway, if it had been that Miss Kennedy's husband by hisself I wouldn't have lifted a finger to, no matter what Captain Butler said.
She's a mighty cold woman.
Prancin' about Atlanta by herself.
She killed her husband same as if she shot him.
You mustn't say unkind things about my sister-in-law.
Please don't freeze me, Miss Wilkes.
I forgot how you liked her.
But she just ain't in the same class with you and I can't help it if I think so.
Well, anyway, I gotta be goin'.
I'm scared somebody'll recognize this carriage if I stayed here any longer.
That wouldn't do you no good.
And Miss Wilkes if you ever see me on the street, you don't have to speak to me.
I'll understand.
I should be proud to speak to you.
Proud to be under obligation to you.
I hope we meet again.
Oh, no, ma'am, that wouldn't be fitting'.
-Good night, Miss Wilkes.
-Good night, Mrs. Watling.
And you're wrong about Mrs. Kennedy.
She's brokenhearted about her husband.
Great balls of fire!
It's Rhett.
Miss Scarlett, Captain Butler here to see you.
I told him you was prostrate with grief.
Tell him I'll be right down, Mammy.
She says she's comin'.
I don't know why she's comin'.
But she's a-comin'.
You don't like me, Mammy.
Now don't you argue with me, you don't.
You really don't.
It's no good, Scarlett.
What?
The cologne.
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.
I mean you've been drinking. Brandy.
Quite a lot.
Well, what if I have? ls that any of your affair?
Don't drink alone, Scarlett.
People always find out and it ruins the reputation.
What is it?
This is more than losing old Frank.
Oh, Rhett I'm so afraid.
I don't believe it.
You've never been afraid in your life.
I'm afraid now.
I'm afraid of dying and going to hell.
You look pretty healthy, and maybe there isn't any hell.
Oh, there is.
I know there is.
I was raised on it.
Well, far be it from me to question the teachings of childhood.
Tell me what you've done that hell yawns before you.
I ought never to have married Frank to begin with.
He was Suellen's beau and he loved her, not me.
And I made him miserable.
And I killed him.
Yes, I did!
I killed him!
For the first time I'm finding out what it is to be sorry for something I've done.
Here.
Dry your eyes.
If you had it all to do over again, you'd do no differently.
You're like the thief who isn't the least bit sorry he stole but he's terribly, terribly sorry he's going to jail.
I'm glad Mother's dead.
I'm glad she's dead so she can't see me.
I always wanted to be like her, calm and kind and....
And I certainly have turned out disappointing.
You know, Scarlett, I think you're on the verge of a crying jag.
So I'll change the subject and say what I came to say.
Say it, then, and get out!
What is it?
That I can't go on any longer without you.
You are the most ill-bred man to come here at a time like this with your filthy--
I made up my mind that you were the only woman for me the first day I saw you at Twelve Oaks.
Now that you've got the lumber mill and Frank's money you won't come to me as you did to the jail.
So I see I shall have to marry you.
I never heard of such bad taste.
Would you be more convinced if I fell to my knees?
Turn me loose, you varmint, and get out of here!
Forgive me for startling you with the impetuosity of my sentiments my dear Scarlett.
I mean, my dear Mrs. Kennedy.
But it cannot have escaped your notice that for some time past the friendship I have felt for you has ripened into a deeper feeling.
A feeling more beautiful, more pure, more sacred.
Dare I name it?
Can it be love?
Get up off your knees.
I don't like your common jokes.
This is an honorable proposal of marriage made at what I consider a most opportune moment.
I can't go all my life waiting to catch you between husbands.
You're coarse, and you're conceited.
And I think this conversation has gone far enough.
Besides, I shall never marry again.
Oh, yes, you will, and you'll marry me.
You?
You!
I don't love you!
And I don't like being married.
Did you ever think of marrying just for fun?
Marriage, fun?
Fiddle-dee-dee.
Fun for men, you mean.
Hush up!
Do you want them to hear you?
You've been married to a boy and an old man.
Why not try a husband of the right age, with a way with women?
You're a fool, Rhett Butler, when you know I shall always love another man.
Stop it!
Do you hear me, Scarlett? Stop it!
No more of that talk.
Rhett, don't, I shall faint.
I want you to faint.
This is what you were meant for.
None of the fools you've known have kissed you like this, have they?
Your Charles, or your Frank, or your stupid Ashley.
Say you're going to marry me.
Say "yes." Say "yes! "
Yes.
Are you sure you meant it?
You don't want to take it back?
No.
Look at me and try to tell me the truth.
Did you say "yes" because of my money? Well....
Yes.
Partly.
Partly?
Well, you know, Rhett, money does help, and, of course I am fond of you.
Fond of me.
Well, if I said I was madly in love with you, you'd know I was lying but you always said we had a lot in common....
Yes, you're right, my dear.
I'm not in love with you any more than you are with me.
Heaven help the man who ever really loves you.
What kind of a ring would you like, my darling?
Oh, a diamond ring.
And do buy a great big one, Rhett.
You shall have the biggest and the most vulgar ring in Atlanta.
I'll take you to New Orleans for the most expensive honeymoon my ill-gotten gains can buy.
Oh, that would be just heavenly.
And I think I'll buy your trousseau for you, too.
Rhett, how wonderful, but you won't tell anybody, will you, Rhett?
Still the little hypocrite.
Rhett, aren't you going to kiss me goodbye?
Don't you think you've had enough kissing for one afternoon?
You're impossible.
You can go and I don't care if you never come back.
But I will come back.
What are you thinking about, Scarlett?
I'm thinking about how rich we are.
Rhett, I can keep the lumber business too, can't I?
Yes, of course, you can, if it amuses you.
Now that you're rich you can tell everyone to go to the devil as you've always said you wanted to.
But you were the main one I wanted to go to the devil.
Don't scrape the plate, Scarlett.
I'm sure there's more in the kitchen.
Oh, Rhett, can I have one of those chocolate ones stuffed with meringue?
If you don't stop being such a glutton, you'll get as fat as Mammy then I'll divorce you.
Wouldn't it be nice if you bought something for Mammy, too?
Why should I buy her a present when she called us both mules? Mules?
Why mules?
Yes, she said we could give ourselves airs, and get ourselves all slicked up like racehorses but we were just mules in horse harness and we didn't fool anybody.
I never heard anything more true.
Mammy's a smart old soul and one of the few people I know whose respect I'd like to have.
I won't give her a thing.
She doesn't deserve it.
Then I'll take her a petticoat.
My Mammy always said when she went to heaven she wanted a red taffeta petticoat, so stiff that it would stand by itself and so rustly, the Lord would think it was made of angels' wings.
Why, she won't take it from you.
She'd rather die than wear it.
That may be, but I'm making the gesture just the same.
Wake up!
Wake up!
You were having another nightmare.
Oh, Rhett.
When I was so cold and hungry and and so tired I I couldn't find it.
I ran through the mist and I couldn't find it.
-Find what, honey? -Oh, I don't know.
I always dream the same dream and I never know.
It seems to be hidden in the mist.
Darling.
Rhett, do you think I'll ever dream that I've found it and that I'm safe?
Dreams don't work that way, but when you get used to being safe and warm you'll stop dreaming that dream.
And, Scarlett, I'm going to see that you are safe.
Would you do something for me if I asked you?
You know I would.
Will you take me away from here?
Don't you like New Orleans?
Oh, I love New Orleans, but I want to go home and visit Tara.
Will you take me to Tara?
Yes, Scarlett, of course I will.
We'll go tomorrow.
You get your strength from this red earth of Tara, Scarlett.
You're part of it, and it's part of you.
Rhett, I'd give anything to have Tara the way it was before the war. Would you?
Then go ahead and make it that way.
Spend whatever you want, make it as fine a plantation as it ever was.
Oh, Rhett.
Rhett, you are good to me.
And can we still have our big new house in Atlanta?
Yes, and it can be as ornate as you want marbled terraces, stained-glass windows and all.
Rhett, won't everyone be jealous?
I want everybody who's been mean to me to be pea-green with envy.
Scarlett's hateful, building that new house just to show off and even taking our servants.
Oh, darling, you mustn't think unkindly of her.
She's made it possible for us to keep Tara always.
Yes, and what good is Tara?
She's had three husbands and I'll be an old maid.
Great Jehosophat!
Great Jehosophat!
Lordsy, we sure is rich now!
It ain't quality....
But that's ridiculous.
Why can't I go in?
I'm entitled to at least see what my own child looks like.
You control yourself, Mr. Rhett.
You'll be seein' it for a long time.
I'd like to apologize, Mr. Rhett, about it's not being a boy.
Oh, hush your mouth, Mammy. Who wants a boy?
Boys aren't any use to anybody.
Don't you think I'm proof of that?
Have a drink of sherry, Mammy.
Mammy, she is beautiful, isn't she?
She sure is.
Did you ever see a prettier one?
Well, sir, Miss Scarlett was mighty nigh that pretty when she come, but not quite.
Have another glass, Mammy.
What's that rustling noise I hear?
Lordsy, Mr. Rhett.
That ain't nothin' but my red silk petticoat you done give me.
Nothing but your petticoat.
I don't believe it.
Let me see.
Pull up your skirt. Mr. Rhett.
You is bad.
Yeah, oh, Lord!
You sure took a long enough time about wearing it.
Yes, sir, too long.
No more mule in horse's harness?
Mr. Rhett, Miss Scarlett was bad telling' you about that.
You ain't holding' that against old Mammy, is you?
No, I ain't holding it against you.
I just wanted to know.
Have another glass, Mammy.
Here, take the whole bottle.
Dr. Meade says you may go in now, Captain Butler.
This sure is a happy day to me.
I done diapered three generations of this family's girls and it sure is a happy day.
Oh, yes, Mammy.
The happiest days are when babies come.
I wish....
Oh, Mammy, she's beautiful. What do you suppose they'll name her?
Miss Scarlett done told me if it was a girl she's goin' to name it Eugenia Victoria.
Yes she's a beautiful baby the most beautiful baby ever.
Yes.
Do you know that this is your birthday?
That you're a week old today?
Yes, I'm going to buy her a pony the likes of which this town has never seen.
Yes, I'm gonna send her to the best schools in Charleston. Yes.
And her'll be received by the best families in the South.
And when it comes time for her to marry well, she'll be a little princess.
You certainly are making a fool of yourself.
And why shouldn't I?
She's the first person who's ever completely belonged to me.
Great balls of fire!
I had the baby, didn't I?
It's Melanie.
May I come in?
Come in, Melly.
Yes, come in and look at my daughter's beautiful blue eyes.
But, Captain Butler, most babies have blue eyes when they're born.
Don't try to tell him anything.
He knows everything about babies.
Nevertheless, her eyes are blue and they're going to stay blue.
As blue as the bonnie blue flag. That's it.
That's what we'll call her.
Bonnie Blue Butler.
Try again, Mammy.
Twenty inches.
Twenty inches!
I've grown as big as Aunt Pitty.
You've simply got to make it 18 and a half again, Mammy.
You done had a baby, Miss Scarlett and you ain't never goin' to be no 18 and a half inches again.
And there ain't nothin' to do about it.
There is something to do about it!
I'm just not going to get old and fat before my time.
I just won't have any more babies!
I heard Mr. Rhett say that he'll be wantin' a son next year.
Go tell Captain Butler I've decided not to go out after all.
I'll have supper in my room.
I got your message.
I'll have them bring my supper up here too.
No objections to that, I hope?
No.
Yes.
I mean, I don't care where you have your supper.
Rhett?
Yes?
You see well, I've decided well, I hope I don't have any more children.
My pet, as I told you before Bonnie was born it's immaterial to me whether you have one child or 20!
No, but you know what I.... Do you know what I mean?
I do.
And do you know I can divorce you for this?
You're just low enough to think of something like that!
If you had any chivalry in you or would be nice like, well, look at Ashley Wilkes!
Melanie can't have any more children and he....
You've been to the lumber office this afternoon, haven't you?
What has that got to do with it?
Quite the little gentleman, Ashley.
Pray go on, Mrs. Butler. It's no use.
You wouldn't understand.
You know, I'm sorry for you, Scarlett. Sorry for me?
Yes, sorry for you because you're throwing away happiness with both hands and reaching out for something that will never make you happy.
I don't know what you're talking about.
If you were free and Miss Melly were dead and you had your precious honorable Ashley, do you think you'd be happy with him?
You'd never know him, never even understand his mind any more than you understand anything except money.
Never mind about that!
What I want to know is--
You may keep your sanctity, Scarlett.
It'll work no hardship on me.
Do you mean to say you don't care?
The world is full of many things and many people, and I shan't be lonely.
I'll find comfort elsewhere. Well, that's fine.
But I warn you.
Just in case you change your mind, I intend to lock my door.
Why bother?
If I wanted to come in, no lock could keep me out!
I always knew that most women were cheats, hypocritical and hard. -But this one....
-Rhett, it ain't no use.
-What do you mean?
-I mean you're poisoned with her.
I don't care what she's done to you, you're still in love with her.
And don't think it pleasures me none to say it. Maybe so!
But I'm through with her, I tell you!
I'm through.
You gotta think of the child.
The child's worth ten of the mother.
You're a shrewd woman, Belle, and a very nice one.
Yes, Rhett?
I was just thinking of the difference between you, and you're both hard-headed business women and you're both successful.
But you've got a heart, Belle and you're honest.
Goodbye, Rhett.
Goodbye, Belle.
She'll be a wonderful horsewoman!
Look at those hands, and that seat!
Oh, fiddle-dee-dee!
Just why we have to wheel the baby when we have a house full of servants.... Good morning, Mrs. Merriwether.
Good morning, Captain Butler.
Good morning, Scarlett.
Making fools of ourselves in front of these old buffaloes!
If you'd thought of your position years ago, you wouldn't have to do this.
But as it is, we'll cultivate every female dragon of the old guard in this town.
Good morning, Mrs. Whiting.
Good morning, Captain Butler.
Good morning, Scarlett.
So the millionaire speculator's turning respectable!
All of our money can't buy what I want for Bonnie.
Oh, I'll admit I've been at fault, too.
But Bonnie's going to have a place among decent people.
Yes, even if we both have to crawl on our bellies to every fat old cat.
Good morning, Mrs. Meade.
Good morning, Captain Butler. Good morning, Scarlett.
Mrs. Merriwether, I've always had a great regard for your knowledge.
I wonder if you could give me some advice. Why, certainly, Captain Butler.
My Bonnie sucks her thumb.
I can't make her stop it. You should make her stop it.
It'll ruin the shape of her mouth.
I know, I know.
She has such a beautiful mouth, too.
I tried putting soap under her nails. Soap!
Bah!
Put quinine on her thumb and she'll stop sucking it quick enough.
I never would have thought of it.
I can't thank you enough, Mrs. Merriwether.
You've taken a great load off my mind! Good morning.
Good morning, Dolly.
Wasn't that Captain Butler? Good morning, Caroline.
I was just thinking.
There must be a great deal of good in a man who could love a child so much.
But of course there is!
Oh, did I tell you that Fanny Elsing told Dr. Meade that Captain Butler finally admitted he was honored by the Confederate Congress for his services at the Battle of Franklin?
And did I tell you, Caroline, that Captain Butler made a stupendous contribution to the Association for the Beautification of the Graves of the Glorious Dead?
No!
My little grandbaby, Napoleon Picard, is giving a party for Bonnie next week.
Why, Dolly Merriwether, you know right well it was my idea to give a party for Bonnie Butler!
Why Caroline Meade....
Now watch Daddy put your pony over, Bonnie. Now watch.
Daddy, let me! Let me!
All right, darling.
Put her on, Pork!
Up we go. Oh, there!
Lordsy mercy!
There he goes again!
Grip tightly with your legs and sit close.
Lean forward and be sure you go with him.
Hold your reins properly in a firm hand.
That was fine!
I knew you'd do it!
When you get a little older, I'll take you to Kentucky and Virginia.
You'll be the greatest horsewoman in the South. Give your daddy a kiss.
Mr. Rhett!
Mr. Rhett!
Mr. Rhett!
Did you see her, Mammy? Wasn't she wonderful?
Mr. Rhett, I done told you and told you it just ain't fitting' for a girl child to ride astraddle with her dress flying' up!
All right, Mammy.
I'll teach her to ride sidesaddle.
And I'll buy her a blue velvet riding habit. She'll love that.
A nice black broadcloth is what little girls wear.
Now, Mammy, be reasonable.
Well, I don't think it's fitting', but....
It ain't fitting', it just ain't fitting'.
It ain't fitting'.
Why, Scarlett!
What are you doing downtown at this time of day? Ashley, I just--
Why aren't you helping Melly get ready for my surprise birthday party?
Why, Ashley Wilkes, you aren't supposed to know anything about that.
Melly'd be so disappointed if you weren't surprised. I won't let on.
I'll be the most surprised man in Atlanta.
As long as you're here, let me show you the books so you can see just how bad a businessman I really am.
Oh, don't let's fool with any books today.
When I'm wearing a new bonnet, all the figures I ever knew go right slap out of my head.
The figures are well lost when the bonnet's as pretty as that one.
Scarlett, you know, you get prettier all the time.
You haven't changed a bit since the day of our last barbecue at Twelve Oaks where you sat under a tree surrounded by dozens of beaux.
That girl doesn't exist anymore.
Nothing's turned out as I expected, Ashley. Nothing.
Yes, we've travelled a long road since the old days, haven't we, Scarlett?
Oh, the lazy days the warm, still country twilights the high, soft negro laughter from the quarters the golden warmth and security of those days.
Don't look back, Ashley. Don't look back.
It drags at your heart till you can't do anything, but look back.
I didn't mean to make you sad, my dear.
I'd never want you to be anything but completely happy.
Oh, Ashley!
Who is it? Only your husband.
Come in.
Am I actually being invited into the sanctuary?
You're not ready for Melanie's party. I've got a headache, Rhett.
You go without me, and make my excuses to Melanie.
What a white-livered little coward you are! Get up!
You're going to that party and you'll have to hurry.
-Has India dared to-- -Yes. India has!
Every woman and man in town knows the story!
You should kill them, spreading lies.
I have a strange way of not killing people who tell the truth. There's no time to argue now.
Get up! I won't go!
I can't go until this misunderstanding is cleared up.
You won't cheat Miss Melly out of the satisfaction of publicly ordering you out of her house.
There was nothing wrong.
India hates me so.
I can't go, Rhett.
I couldn't face it.
If you don't show it tonight, you'll never be able to as long as you live.
While that wouldn't bother me, you're ruining Bonnie's chances.
You're going to that party, if only for her sake. Now, get dressed!
Nothing modest or matronly will do for this occasion.
And put on plenty of rouge. I want you to look your part tonight.
-Good night, Scarlett. -But Rhett, you can't--
You go into the arena alone.
The lions are hungry for you. Oh, Rhett, don't leave me.
Don't. You're not afraid?
"Which nobody can deny Which nobody can deny
What a lovely dress, Scarlett, darling. India wasn't able to come tonight.
Will you be an angel?
I do need you to help me receive my guests.
Mrs. Meade here's our darling Scarlett.
Good evening. Good evening.
Why Scarlett!
-Good evening, Miss Scarlett.
-Good evening, Mrs. Butler.
Ashley, aren't you going to get our Scarlett a glass of punch?
Did you have a good time tonight at Miss Melly's party, child? Yes, yes.
Now, Mammy, be sure and leave word if Captain Butler asks for me when he comes back, I'm asleep.
Yes, ma'am.
Come in, Mrs. Butler.
Come here.
Sit down!
There's no reason why you shouldn't have your nightcap even if I am here. I didn't want a drink.
I heard a noise and--
You heard nothing of the kind.
You wouldn't have come down if you'd thought I was here.
-You must need a drink badly. -I do not!
Take it.
Don't give yourself airs.
I know you drink on the quiet, and I know how much you drink.
Do you think I care if you like your brandy?
You're drunk, and I'm going to bed!
I'm very drunk and I intend getting still drunker before the evening's over but you're not going to bed, not yet!
Sit down!
So she stood by you, did she?
How does it feel to have the woman you've wronged cloak your sins for you?
You're wondering if she knows all about you and Ashley.
You're wondering if she did it just to save her face.
You're thinking that she's a fool for doing it even if it did save your hide. -I will not listen.
-Yes, you'll listen!
Miss Melly's a fool, but not the kind you think.
It's just that there's too much honor in her to ever conceive of dishonor in anyone she loves.
And she loves you.
Though just why she does, I'm sure I don't know!
If you weren't so drunk and insulting, I could explain everything. -As it is though--
-If you get out of that chair once more!
Of course, the comic figure in all this is the long suffering Mr. Wilkes!
Mr. Wilkes, who can't be mentally faithful to his wife and won't be unfaithful to her technically.
Why doesn't he make up his mind? Rhett, you....
Observe my hands, my dear.
I could tear you to pieces with them.
And I'd do it, if it'd take Ashley out of your mind forever.
But it wouldn't.
So I'll remove him from your mind forever this way.
I'll put my hands so one on each side of your head and I'll smash your skull between them like a walnut.
And that'll block him out.
Take your hands off me, you drunken fool.
You know I've always admired your spirit, my dear.
Never more than now, when you're cornered. I'm not cornered.
And you'll never corner me, Rhett Butler, or frighten me!
You've lived in dirt so long, you can't understand anything else.
And you're jealous of something you can't understand. Good night!
Jealous, am I? Yes, I suppose I am.
Even though I know you've been faithful to me all along.
How do I know?
Because I know Ashley Wilkes, and his honorable breed. They're gentlemen!
And that's more than I can say for you or for me!
We're not gentlemen, and we have no honor, have we?
It's not that easy, Scarlett.
You turned me out while you chased Ashley Wilkes. While you dreamed of Ashley Wilkes.
This is one night you're not turning me out!
How are you feeling this morning, Mammy?
Well, this misery in my back ain't so good.
You actin' mighty happy this mornin', Miss Scarlett. I am, Mammy.
I am.
"Oh, she wept with delight when he gave her a smile
"And trembled with fear at his frown."
Hello.
I'd like to extend my apologies for my conduct of last night. Oh, but Rhett....
I was very drunk and quite swept off my feet by your charms.
Well, you needn't bother to apologize. Nothing you ever do surprises me!
I've been thinking things over, and I really believe that it would be better for both of us if we admitted we'd made a mistake and got a divorce.
-A divorce?
-Yes.
There's no point in our holding on to each other, is there?
I'll provide for you amply. You've plenty of grounds.
Just give me Bonnie.
You can say what you please, I won't contest it.
Thank you very much.
But I wouldn't dream of disgracing the family with a divorce.
You'd disgrace it quick enough if Ashley were free.
It makes my head spin to think how quickly you'd divorce me.
Wouldn't you, Scarlett?
Well, answer me. Wouldn't you?
Will you please go now, and leave me alone?
That's what I came to tell you.
I'm going on a very extended trip to London, and I'm leaving today.
And I'm taking Bonnie with me.
So you'll please get her little duds packed right away.
You'll never take my child out of this house. She's my child, too, Scarlett.
You're making a mistake, if you think I'm leaving her here with a mother who hasn't the decency to consider her own reputation.
You're a fine one to talk.
You think I'll let that child out of this house when you'll probably have her around with people like that Belle?
If you were a man I'd break your neck for that.
As it is, I'll thank you to shut your stupid mouth.
As for you, giving yourself pious airs about your motherhood....
Why, a cat's a better mother than you are.
Have her things packed and ready for me in an hour, or I warn you....
I've always thought a good lashing with a buggy whip would benefit you immensely.
Excuse me, Mr. Rhett. Hello, Uncle Rhett.
Hello, hello, Beau.
Daddy, Daddy!
Where have you been?
I've been waiting for you all morning.
Well, I've been hunting for a rabbit skin to wrap my little Bonnie in. Give your best sweetheart a kiss.
I'm going to take you on a long trip to fairyland! Where?
Where?
I'm going to show you the Tower of London, where the little princes were and London Bridge.
London Bridge!
Will it be falling down?
Well, it will if you want it to, darling.
Daddy, dark!
Dark! Daddy! Dark!
It's all right.
Who put out that light?
Nurse! Daddy, dark!
Daddy, dark! There.
Yes, yes.
What's the matter with my Bonnie? A bear.
Oh, a bear?
A big bear?
Dreadful big.
And he sat on my chest.
Well, I'll stay here and shoot him if he comes back.
Good evening, Mr. Butler.
Haven't I told you never to leave her alone in the dark?
If you'll pardon me, sir, children are often afraid of the dark, but they get over it. If you just let her scream for a night or two.
Let her scream!
Either you're a fool or the most inhuman woman I've ever seen!
Of course, sir, if you want her to grow up nervous and cowardly. Cowardly!
There isn't a cowardly bone in her body.
As you say, sir.
Where is Mother?
Aren't you happy here in London with me?
I want to go home.
Miss Bonnie! And Captain Butler!
-Miss Scarlett!
-Hello, Mammy.
Honey, child!
They's back!
They's back, Miss Scarlett!
Bonnie!
Bonnie!
Bonnie, baby! Darling, baby!
Are you glad to be home?
Daddy gave me a kitten.
-What a little, lovely kitten!
-London's a horrid place.
-Oh, my darling.
-Where's my pony?
-I want to go out and see my pony.
-You go out and see your pony.
Where's my pony?
I wanna go out and see my pony.
You run along with Mammy. -Come on, honey child.
-Go with Mammy.
Mammy sure has missed you, honey.
Mrs. Butler, I believe.
Mammy said you'd come back.
But only to bring Bonnie.
Apparently any mother, even a bad one, is better for a child than none.
You mean you're going away again? What perception, Mrs. Butler.
Right away.
In fact, I left my bags at the station.
You're looking pale. Is there a shortage of rouge?
Or can this wanness mean you've been missing me?
If I'm pale, it's your fault.
Not because I've been missing you, but because....
Pray continue, Mrs. Butler.
It's because I'm going to have a baby.
And who's the happy father?
You know it's yours.
I don't want it any more than you do.
No woman would want the child of a cad like you.
I wish it were anybody's child but yours.
Maybe you'll have an accident.
Has she asked for me? Don't you understand?
She's delirious.
Rhett!
I want Rhett!
What's the matter, honey? Did you call somebody, child?
It's no use.
It's no use.
Scarlett's dead!
Oh, no, she's much better.
Really she is.
There, there, Captain Butler. You're beside yourself.
She'll very soon be well again, I promise you.
No, you don't understand.
She never wanted this baby.
Not want a baby?
Why, every woman wants a baby!
Yes, you want children, but she doesn't.
Not my children.
She told me she didn't want any more children and I wanted to hurt her because she'd hurt me.
I wanted to and I did.
Hush.
You mustn't tell me these things.
It's not fit.
I didn't know about this baby until the other day when she fell.
If I'd known, I'd have come straight home whether she wanted me or not! Well, of course you would.
And then when she told me, there on the steps, what did I do?
I laughed and I said--
But you didn't mean it.
I know you didn't mean it.
Oh, but I did mean it.
I was crazy with jealousy.
She's never cared for me.
I thought I could make her care, but I couldn't.
You're so wrong.
Scarlett loves you a great deal, much more than she knows.
If that were only true I could wait forever. If she'd only forgive me, forget this ever happened.
She will.
You must be patient.
Oh, no, it's not possible. If you only knew who she really loved you wouldn't believe it.
Surely you haven't listened to idle gossip. No, Captain Butler, I wouldn't believe it.
Scarlett's going to get well and there can be other babies.
Oh no, no, she couldn't even if she wanted to, after what she's been through. But of course she could.
I'm going to.
No, Miss Melly, you mustn't risk it. It's too dangerous.
Children are life renewing itself, Captain Butler and when life does that danger seems very unimportant.
I've never before known anyone who was really brave.
I pray God things go well with you, Miss Melly.
And I want to thank you for all you've done for me and for Scarlett. From my heart, I thank you.
Miss Scarlett's feelin' a heap better today, Mr. Rhett. Thank you, Mammy.
I've come to ask your forgiveness in the hope that we can give our life together another chance.
When did we ever have a life together?
Yes, you're right.
But I'm sure if we could only try again, we could be happy.
Well, what is there to make us happy now?
Well, there's Bonnie and and I love you, Scarlett.
When did you discover that?
I've always loved you, but you've never given me a chance to show it.
Well, and just what do you want me to do?
To begin with, give up the mill, Scarlett. We'll go away.
We'll take Bonnie and we'll have another honeymoon.
Give up the mill? But why?
It's making more money than ever.
Yes, I know, but we don't need it.
Sell it, or better still, give it to Ashley.
Melanie's been such a friend to both of us.
Always Melanie!
If you'd only think a little more about me....
I am thinking of you and I'm thinking that well, maybe it's the mill that's taken you away from me and from Bonnie.
I know what you're thinking.
Don't try to bring Bonnie into this.
You're the one taking her away from me.
But she loves you.
You've done everything possible to make her love you and not me.
Why, she's so spoiled now that--
Mommy! Daddy!
Watch me!
We're watching, darling.
You're mighty pretty, precious.
So are you.
I'm going to jump.
Watch me, Daddy.
I don't think you ought to do much jumping yet, Bonnie.
Remember, you've just learned to ride sidesaddle. I will so jump!
I can jump better than ever 'cause I've grown and I've moved the bar higher.
Don't let her do it, Rhett.
No, Bonnie, you can't.
Well, if you fall off, don't cry and blame me.
Rhett, stop her!
Bonnie!
Bonnie!
Bonnie!
I sure is glad you has come.
This house won't seem the same without Bonnie. How's Miss Scarlett bearing up?
Miss Melly, this here done broke her heart but I didn't fetch you here on Miss Scarlett's account.
What that child got to stand, the good Lord give her strength to stand.
It's Mr. Rhett I's worried about.
He done lost his mind these last couple of days. No, Mammy, no.
I ain't never see'd no man, black or white, set such store on any child.
When Dr. Meade says her neck broke Mr. Rhett grab his gun and run out there and shoot that poor pony and for a minute I think he going to shoot hisself.
Yes, ma'am.
Miss Scarlett, she call him a murderer for teaching' that child to jump.
She say, "You give me my baby what you kill." And then he say Miss Scarlett ain't never cared nothing' about Miss Bonnie.
It like to turn my blood cold, the things they say to one another.
Stop, Mammy, don't tell me any more.
And then that night Mr. Rhett, he locked hisself in the nursery with Miss Bonnie and he wouldn't even open the door when Miss Scarlett beat on it and hollered to him.
And that's the way it's been for two whole days.
Oh, Mammy.
And then this evenin', Miss Scarlett, she shout through the door and she say the funeral set for tomorrow mornin' and he says "You try that and I kills you tomorrow.
"Do you think I's goin' to put my child away in the...
"...in the dark when she's so scared of it?"
Oh, Mammy, he has lost his mind.
Yes, ma'am, that's the God's truth.
He ain't goin' to let us bury that child.
You gotta help us, Miss Melly.
Oh, but I can't intrude.
If you can't help us, who can?
Mr. Rhett always set great store by your opinion.
I'll do what I can, Mammy.
Get away from that door, and leave us alone. It's Mrs. Wilkes, Captain Butler.
Please let me in.
I've come to see Bonnie.
Oh, Lord please help Mr. Rhett in this hour of his grief.
I want you to go and make a good deal of strong coffee and bring it up to Captain Butler.
I'll go and see Miss Scarlett.
But....
Captain Butler is quite willing for the funeral to take place tomorrow morning.
Hallelujah.
I suspects the angels fights on your side, Miss Melly. Hallelujah.
Miss Melly!
Miss Melly!
Miss Melly! Miss Melly!
Send for Dr. Meade, Mammy and try try to get me home.
Miss Melly!
Where is my mother goin' away to? And why can't I go along, please?
We can't always go along, Beau, much as we may want to.
Oh, Rhett, she can't be dying, she can't be!
She's never had any strength.
She's never had anything but heart.
You knew that, too.
Why do I have to go back to bed?
It's morning.
It isn't really morning yet.
Dr. Meade, please let me see her!
I've been waiting here two whole days and I've got to tell her that I was wrong about something.
She knows you were wrong.
She wants to see Scarlett.
Miss Melly's going to die in peace.
I won't have you easing your conscience telling her things that make no difference now. You understand?
Promise me?
Anything.
Look after my little son.
I gave him to you once before.
Remember?
The day he was born.
Please, Melly, don't talk this way.
I know you'll get well.
Promise me college....
Yes, yes, and Europe, and a pony, whatever he wants.
But Melly, do try....
Ashley....
Ashley and you.
What about Ashley, Melly? Look after him for me.
Just as you looked after me for him.
Look after him but never let him know.
Promise?
What else, Melly?
Captain Butler be kind to him.
Rhett?
He loves you so.
Goodbye.
I don't know where the mate to this is.
She must have put it away.
Oh, stop it.
Hold me.
I'm so frightened.
I'm so frightened.
I can't live without her, I can't.
Everything I ever had is is going with her.
Oh, Ashley.
You really love her, don't you?
She's the only dream I ever had that didn't die in the face of reality.
Always dreams with you, never common sense.
Oh, Scarlett! If you knew what I've gone through!
Ashley, you should have told me years ago that you loved her and not me and not left me dangling with your talk of honor.
But you had to wait till now, now when Melly's dying to show me that I could never mean any more to you than than this Watling woman does to Rhett.
And I've loved something that that doesn't really exist.
Somehow I don't care.
Somehow it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter one bit.
Don't cry. She mustn't see you've been crying.
Ashley!
Melly!
Melanie, she's....
She was the only completely kind person I ever knew.
A great lady.
A very great lady.
So she's dead.
That makes it nice for you, doesn't it?
Oh, how can you say such a thing?
You know how I loved her, really!
No, I don't know that I do.
But at least it's to your credit that you could appreciate her at the end.
Of course I appreciated her. She thought of everybody except herself.
Why her last words were about you.
What did she say?
She said: "Be kind to Captain Butler.
He loves you so."
She said she asked me to look after Ashley, too.
It's convenient to have the first wife's permission, isn't it?
What are you doing?
I'm leaving you, my dear.
All you need now is a divorce, and your dreams of Ashley can come true.
No, you're wrong! Terribly wrong!
I don't want a divorce.
Oh, Rhett, when I knew tonight when I knew I loved you, I ran home to tell you.
Oh, darling, darling....
Please don't go on with this.
Leave us some dignity to remember out of our marriage.
Spare us this last. This last?
Oh, Rhett, do listen to me.
I must have loved you for years, only I was such a stupid fool I didn't know it.
Please believe me. You must care.
Melly said you did.
I believe you. What about Ashley Wilkes?
I never really loved Ashley.
You certainly gave a good imitation of it, up till this morning.
No, Scarlett.
If you'd only met me half way, even when I came back from London.
I was so glad to see you.
I was, Rhett, but you were so nasty.
And then, when you were sick and it was all my fault I hoped against hope that you'd call for me, but you didn't.
I wanted you.
I wanted you desperately, but I didn't think you wanted me. It seems we've been at cross purposes, doesn't it?
But it's no use now.
As long as there was Bonnie, there was a chance we might be happy.
I liked to think that Bonnie was you.
A little girl again, before the war, and poverty had done things to you.
She was so like you, and I could pet her, and spoil her, as I wanted to spoil you.
Oh, Rhett! Rhett, please don't say that.
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry for everything.
My darling, you're such a child.
You think that by saying, "l'm sorry," all the past can be corrected.
Never, at any crisis of your life, have I known you to have a handkerchief.
Rhett, where are you going? I'm going to Charleston. Back where I belong.
Please.
Please take me with you.
No.
I'm through with everything here.
I want peace.
I want to see if somewhere there isn't something left in life of charm and grace.
-Do you know what I'm talking about?
I only know that I love you.
That's your misfortune.
Oh, Rhett.
If you go, where shall I go?
What shall I do?
Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.
I can't! There must be some way to bring him back.
I'll go crazy if I do!
I'll think about it tomorrow.
I must think about it.
What is there to do?
What is there that matters?
Do you mean to tell me, Katie Scarlett O'Hara that Tara doesn't mean anything to you?
Why, land's the only thing that matters.
It's the only thing that lasts.
Something you love better than me, though you may not know it.
Tara. It's this from which you get your strength.
The red earth of Tara. Why, land's the only thing that matters.
It's the only thing that lasts.
Something you love better than me, though you may not know it.
Tara. This from which you get your strength.
The red earth of Tara.
Why, land's the only thing that matters.
Something you love better than me. The red earth of Tara.
-Tara!
-Tara!
Home!
I'll go home!
And I'll think of some way to get him back.
After all tomorrow is another day.
Charles Chaplin in "The Great Dictator (1940)"
At the end of the World War Tomainia weakened,
Revolution had broken out, her diplomats sued for peace while Tomainia's army fought on, confident its war machine would smash the enemy's lines,
Big Bertha, able to fire 100 miles, was to make its appearance on the Western Front, and strike terror into the enemy,
75 miles away was her target:
the cathedral of Notre-Dame,
Range: 95,452.
Stand clear!
Fire!
Stand by your trigger!
Range correction: 95,455.
Breach secured.
Stand clear.
Ready...
Fire!
Defective shell.
We'll examine it.
Check the fuse.
Yes, the fuse.
Look out!
Run!
What's that?
- Air raid.
- After Big Bertha.
The anti-aircraft gun!
To the gun!
have you gone crazy?
Come down!
What do you think you're doing?
have you gone crazy?
Sir, the enemy have broken through.
every man to the front.
Muster the gun crew!
Get your hand grenades, soldiers.
Where's your hand grenade?
Give him one.
Keep moving. Come along, hurry up!
Pardon me, but to work this...
Pull the pin, count to ten and throw it!
Let them have it!
This is no time to scratch.
Pull yourself together.
Take this.
Forward!
Fall in!
Hey you, come on!
Order arms!
Prepare to attack.
Forward!
There you are.
The enemy!
Come on, let's get him!
May I come in, sir?
- Who is it?
- Friend.
- What division?
- 21st artillery, sir.
Take this and keep firing. I'll be back.
Comrade! Help!
What is it?
I'm exhausted. Quick, help me to my plane.
Thank you. I'll see you get the Tomainian Cross for this.
Only too willing to oblige, sir.
You saved my life.
Thank you.
I'll strap you in.
I can't make it alone. You'll have to stay with me.
Can you fly?
I can try.
Lift my hand to the stick. I haVen't the strength.
Take charge of that gun!
The enemy!
Quick, lift my hand to the throttle.
We'll fool 'em!
Hold on to these dispatches.
If we get them to General Schmelloffel,
Tomainia may yet win.
I'm going to faint.
Don't say that.
Sorry.
Where am I?
Don't you know me?
Yes, I feel better now.
The blood's returning to my head.
What's below?
The sun?
Shining upwards.
Strange.
How's the gas?
Kept me awake all night.
No, the gasoline in the tank!
Almost empty.
We must be nearly there. What time is it?
Approximately one minute to twelve.
Strange.
We seem to be defying the laws of gravity.
Water. Quick, I'm going to faint.
Wait a while.
We'll get into trouble if you faint any more.
Just hold it.
I think I...
Now...
Take it!
Something's wrong.
I can't reach it.
It's all gone.
What's the matter?
Belt too tight.
Loosen it.
I'm trying to!
We're upside down.
I know it!
The stick!
Impossible.
There it goes.
We're out of gas.
Well, I suppose this is the end.
Cigarette?
Not now!
I shan't need this any more.
What month is it?
April.
Spring in Tomainia.
Hilda will be in the garden, tending the daffodils.
How she loves daffodils!
She'd never cut them for fear of hurting them.
It was like taking a life to cut a daffodil.
Sweet, gentle Hilda.
A beautiful soul.
She loved animals, and little children, too.
We've landed!
Dispatches!
Comrade, where are you?
The dispatches...
Where are they?
- Are you hurt?
- Take me to General Schmelloffel.
If we don't deliver these, we're defeated.
- The war's over.
- What? We lost.
Hynkel takes power, The Jewish soldier suffered a loss of memory and remained in hospital for years, ignorant of the change in Tomainia,
Hynkel ruled the nation with an iron fist,
Under the double-cross emblem liberty was banished,
Only the voice of Hynkel was heard,
Adenoid Hynkel said,
"Tomainia was down but today has risen,"
"Democracy is fragrant,"
"Liberty is odious,"
"Freedom of speech is objectionable,"
"Tomainia has the greatest army,"
"The greatest navy,"
"But to remain great we must sacrifice,"
"We must tighten our belts,"
He now speaks to Field Marshal Herring, Minister of War,
Now Herr Garbitsch, Minister of the Interior,
He remembers his early struggles, shared by his two loyal comrades,
A reference to the Jewish people,
The Phooey remarks that for the world he has peace in his heart
We now pause for station identification,
This is the Pari-Mutual network, bringing you
Hynkel's address to the children of the double-cross,
The interpreter is Hynkel's personal translator, reading from a prepared manuscript,
Stand by for further commentary, Go ahead, Tomainia,
His Excellency is about to descend the stairs,
Your Excellency, are you hurt?
Ride in the other car.
His Excellency seems pleased as he is greeted by Tomainian children,
He pauses before a woman with a child,
Camera!
Even the baby is thrilled and seems all smiles at the attention,
His Excellency leaves the scene and will return along Hynkelstrasse, where he'll pass Tomainia's modern masterpieces:
the Venus of Today and the Thinker of Tomorrow,
- How was it?
Very good.
Your reference to the Jews might have been more violent.
What?
To arouse the people's anger.
Violence against the Jews might make the people forget their stomach.
You're right. Things have been quiet in the ghetto lately.
Good morning, Mr Jaeckel.
What's good about it?
Conditions could be worse.
If you think so, you have a great imagination.
You heard Hynkel's speech.
I heard nothing. I'Ve got my own troubles.
You're better off than a lot of people.
What about the barber?
Still in hospital.
He's been there since the war.
Why not rent his barbershop for him?
He won't let me. every few weeks he writes to say he's coming back.
A pity it should be idle all these years.
Why worry?
The government will soon take it from him.
Perhaps you're right. Not such a good morning after all.
Now you said it.
Hannah.
On the mantelpiece is my tobacco pouch. Will you get it?
Everyone is full of troubles.
Yeah, everyone. Look at Hannah, poor girl.
A hard worker, can't get a job.
Father was killed in the war, mother died last year.
Can't earn enough to pay her rent.
What can I do?
I can't throw her out.
You need some more.
- Where are you going? - Mrs Shoemaker's laundry.
You'd better take the key. Mrs Jaeckel and I are going out.
I'm locking up in case the storm troopers start their monkey business again.
Aryan!
We're Aryans!
And we go marching by!
Look, fellows!
Tomatoes and potatoes.
I'll take a box home.
Hey, the lorry.
Hold it there, will you?
You have no right!
Just charge it to my account!
Nice ripe tomatoes.
Why don't some of you do something?
If I were a man I'd show you.
What would you do, pretty?
Not one of you has the guts to stand up alone and fight!
Is the lorry in case someone hits back?
Shut up!
Come and take me. You'll get medals for it.
You pick on women and rob defenceless people.
Don't rob the poor girl, boys.
Give her back her tomatoes.
I'll have to do it again.
Pigs!
- Patient 33!
An interesting case: amnesia.
Jewish soldier. Been here since the war.
He thinks it's only been weeks.
Does he knows what's happened?
No.
His one interest seems to be in his barbershop, which he believes he left a few weeks ago.
He'll have many surprises.
I'm afraid so.
- Yes? - Number 33 is gone,
He was to be examined.
But he's disappeared,
Disappeared?
Let him go. It isn't a serious case.
There's little we can do for him.
Come on, get out of here!
What are you doing?
I don't know. leave that alone.
- Don't be silly.
- I'm not silly!
I appreciate that. When you talk to me, "Hail Hynkel"!
Who are you?
I'll show you who I am!
Come down to headquarters!
That's my shop. I don't care if it is or not.
Going to put up a fight, are you?
Come to headquarters.
Let me tell you something.
Policeman? Arrest that man for assault.
- Come here, you!
- leave me alone. Attacking a storm trooper!
You'll hear from my lawyer.
He bit my finger!
Sorry, I didn't mean to hit you.
I enjoyed that.
But you'd better beat it.
- I'll call a policeman.
- No!
- Why not?
- Are you crazy?
More are coming! - More what?
Come in here.
What's wrong with you?
What's this?
Who hit you? I think it was a gang.
You'd better get fixed up. We'll investigate later.
What time is it?
All right, they've gone. Thanks, mister.
That did me a lot of good.
You'Ve sure got some nerve.
We should all fight back.
We can't fight alone, but we can lick 'em together.
We didn't do so bad.
You're the barber, who was in hospital!
Mr Jaeckel has talked about you.
We didn't think you'd come back.
The storm troopers will be after you.
You'd better hide. I'll get the key to the cellar.
- Is this the man?
- That's him. Hail Hynkel!
Who's he?
Don't fool with me.
Your hands.
Just a moment. Not here.
First you'll finish this.
Go on, paint that!
Wait a minute, boys.
I've got a bright idea.
Commander Schultz!
First in command.
Second in command.
Oh, never mind.
You! Who told you to hang people from lampposts?
What was the trouble?
A Jew attacking storm troopers.
- Where is he?
- There. Break ranks.
So there you are.
Get up.
You? Don't you remember me?
- You saved my life.
- Me?
Strange. And I always thought of you as an Aryan.
I'm a vegetarian.
Don't you remember? We got away in my plane.
Plane?
Then we crashed.
Now I remember.
Well, how are you?
What's my friend done? He resisted my men painting his windows.
Any brave man would resist.
I'm sorry for this. No harm.
In future you will not be molested again.
If you or your friends ever need help...
Who did that?
One of my friends.
Hynkel's palace was the centre of the world's greatest war machine,
Behind it was the dynamic Adenoid Hynkel, whose genius ran the nation, whose ceaseless activity kept him occupied every moment of the day,
Marshal Herring is waiting,
I believe we've got something now.
A bulletproof uniform. The material is as light as silk.
Where? I've arranged for a demonstration. It will only take two minutes.
I can spare one.
Professor Herr Kibitzen.
Actions speak louder than words.
A bulletproof uniform. One hundred percent perfect.
Shoot!
Far from perfect.
- Where's my secretary?
- In the outer office.
Take a letter.
Herring here in the tower room, We've got something marvellous,
I shall be up.
A parachute. The most compact in the world.
Worn like a hat.
It will open in 25 feet.
Demonstrate, professor.
Herring, why do you waste my time like this?
Send Garbitsch here.
Herr Garbitsch is waiting,
What's the meaning of this?
25 million for prison camps?
We need to manufacture munitions.
- We'Ve made a few arrests.
- How many?
Five or ten thousand... a day.
- A day? - Just a few dissenters.
Dissenting about?
Working hours, wage cuts, the synthetic food, the quality of the sawdust in the bread.
What more do they want?
It's from the finest lumber!
nevertheless, the people are overworked. They need diversion.
The people, bah!
We might go further with the Jews.
Burn some of their houses. An assault on the ghetto.
Something more dramatic.
When can we be ready to invade Osterlich?
Three months. I can't wait. Napaloni's army might invade first.
We must strike now.
We'll require foreign capital.
Borrow it! The bankers have refused.
One man might make us a loan:
Epstein.
- Epstein? He's a Jew, isn't he?
Well, let's be big about it. We'll borrow from Epstein.
It might be difficult in view of our policy towards his people.
Then we'll change our policy.
Tell Schultz all persecution of the Jews must cease.
At least till we've negotiated this loan.
I don't understand it. The whole ghetto is so quiet.
You can't imagine what was going on.
This Hynkel business.
You weren't here, you were in the hospital, unconscious.
You don't appreciate what a good time you were having.
If things get worse we can go to Osterlich.
That's still free.
Sooner or later we'll have to go.
Anyway, it's nice to see you back.
It's like the old days again, eh?
How's business?
Very slow.
The men are in concentration camp.
You should fix up the women.
The beauty parlour business.
Know anything about it?
You can learn. You can practise on Hannah.
Hannah, get in that chair, we'll make you look beautiful.
What for?
He's going to practise on you.
Not with mud on my face?
No, we'll take some off.
Make me look beautiful?
Sure. He can't make you look any worse!
Mrs Shoemaker's laundry!
I'll give it to her. You sit here and enjoy yourself.
I know. I've seen you making eyes.
Don't pay any attention to him.
I like your shop since it's fixed up.
I wish I had a business like this. There's no future in housework.
Maybe if I save my money I can have a barbershop some day.
But I can never save. Money slips through my fingers.
I've always lived up to every penny I'Ve earned.
Why shouldn't I?
You're here today and gone tomorrow.
Do you believe in God?
I do. But if there wasn't one, would you live any different?
I wouldn't.
Life could be wonderful if people'd leave you alone.
Things are looking brighter now.
Maybe because of you saving Schultz.
Funny how they'Ve left us alone.
Too good to be true.
Do you ever daydream?
That's the only time I'm really happy: dreaming.
Sometimes I get so carried away I don't know what I'm doing.
Aren't you like that?
We're very much alike.
- Both absent-minded.
I like absent-minded people.
Like the man who put his watch in boiling water and held the egg!
All great men are absent-minded. It's a sign you're smart.
My folks didn't think so.
You have an excuse. You were injured in the war.
I was born that way.
I wonder why women never grow whiskers.
Isn't that foolish of me?
I could kick myself in the shins, I could...
I'll give you a shampoo.
Ain't I cute?
How did you do it?
You should try it on yourself.
Fixed up, you'd look handsome.
Four pecks a pound, new potatoes!
The potato man!
I haVe to go.
Take it easy there.
Did you hurt yourself?
- Careful next time.
- Here's another one.
How do you do?
Something's happened. The storm troopers helped me up.
How wonderful if they stopped hating us, if they let us go about our business like we used to.
How wonderful if we didn't have to go to another country.
I don't want to go.
With all the persecution, I still love it here.
Perhaps we don't have to go.
Wouldn't it be wonderful if they'd let us live and be happy again?
Full stop.
Nothing works!
Not even a sharp pencil.
I'm surrounded by incompetent, stupid, sterile stenographers.
I'll get you a pen.
Don't bother!
I won't send it.
Get out, get out!
We've just discovered the most wonderful poison gas.
It will kill everybody...
All right.
B76 to see Herr Herring,
A lady. My secret agent.
Your secret agent?
Tell her to come here.
Have B76 come right in.
Any news from Epstein?
Our agent reports that all the board of directors are Aryans.
- The loan's bound to go through.
A strike at the arms factory.
- The leader?
- Five of them.
- have them shot.
- They were.
How many were going to strike?
Three thousand of them.
have them all shot.
I don't want dissatisfied workers.
These men are skilled craftsmen.
Let's train others first, then shoot them!
Cannot afford to be lenient.
The rhythm of production will be affected.
Rhythm...
All right, have your rhythm.
Spare the strikers and permit them to return to work.
But mark them for future reference.
That's my department. I'll attend to that. This way.
The strike leaders are all brunettes. Not one blond.
Troublemakers!
Worse than Jews.
- Then wipe them out!
- "Doucement".
We'll get rid of the Jews first, then concentrate on the brunettes.
We shall never have peace till we have a pure Aryan race.
How wonderful!
Tomainia, a nation of blue-eyed blonds.
Why not a blond Europe, Asia, America?
- And a brunette dictator.
- Of the world!
Why not?
Aut Caesar aut nullus. The world's effete, worn out, afraid.
No nation would dare oppose you.
Dictator of the World!
It's your destiny.
We'll kill off the Jews, wipe out the brunettes, then will come forth a pure Aryan race.
Beautiful blond Aryans. They will love you, they will worship you as a god.
No, you mustn't say it.
You make me afraid of myself.
Dictator of the World!
We'll invade Osterlich first. After that we can bluff.
The nations will capitulate.
The world will be under your thumb.
leave me!
I want to be alone.
Aut Caesar aut nullus,
Emperor of the World!
My world.
The happy hour programme,
Work with the rhythm of music,
Our next selection:
Brahms' Hungarian Dance number five,
Fifteen cents, please.
Happy hour signing off,
At six, Adenoid Hynkel will address the children of the double-cross,
It seems like the old days again.
How long is it going to last?
In the papers it's rumoured that Hynkel's going to give the Jews back their rights.
Maybe.
What do you want?
Business is much better. Nobody interferes with us any more.
Doesn't that make you feel good?
The trouble, Mr Jaeckel, is you're so used to bad times, you're unhappy without them.
Get my Sunday shoes. They're on the windowsill.
I can't find the shawl.
I'Ve got a shawl.
What's going on?
They're dressing Hannah up to go out.
Is that so?
She's got a beau.
- Who is it?
- The barber.
Now, turn around.
- My dear!
Those hands!
- What's the matter with them?
Those calluses. They're so rough.
Maybe I better not go.
Don't be foolish. He knows you do housework.
Wait! I'll get a pair of mittens.
See if he's ready.
Not yet. He's polishing a bald man's head.
Bad news. The invasion of Osterlich will have to be delayed.
- What?
- Epstein refuses to lend the money.
Epstein refuses, eh?
Send for Schultz.
Epstein refuses.
What did he say?
He complained of the persecution and said he wouldn't have any dealings with a mediaeval maniac.
He'll deal with a mediaeval maniac more than he thinks!
First I shall deal with his people.
- Your Excellency?
- Call out the storm troopers.
A little mediaeval entertainment in the ghetto!
At such a time I think it ill-advised.
Such demonstrations demoralise the country.
Indeed?
Since when do you care about the ghetto?
I speak in the interests of our party and the cause of humanity.
You need a holiday.
Fresh air.
A little outdoor exercise.
I'll send you to a concentration camp.
Place Schultz under arrest.
Very well, but remember my words.
Your cause is doomed to failure because it is built on the stupid persecution of innocent people.
Your policy is worse than a crime. It's a tragic blunder.
Traitor!
Traitor!
You're a double-dyed democrat!
Schultz, why have you forsaken me?
Excellency, here are the notes for your speech.
I'll not need them.
What I say will not be directed to the children of the double-cross but to the children of Israel!
That Hynkel isn't such a bad fellow after all.
Most amusing.
Get a Hynkel badge!
A Hynkel badge!
A fine photo on each!
- We'd better go home.
- Yeah.
Let's hurry.
Wait a minute.
What's that?
Turn off the radio.
The storm troopers!
- Bar that door!
- Get some water!
Get the women and children upstairs. Lock all the doors.
You men, stay right here.
We'Ve got to make a stand.
We might as well die as live like this.
Wait a minute. We have a social call to make here.
Wait a minute!
Schultz gave strict orders not to molest anyone in this court.
These Jews attacked us.
I don't care.
Orders were to keep out.
You saw that!
I can't help it. Schultz's orders.
Let's get going.
Orders or not, I'm going to get that girl.
Out!
Schultz arrested!
Hear that?
He's arrested Commander Schultz.
- A Jew corrupted our commander.
- Let's kill the louse!
Schultz is accused of treason, and you know why.
Schultz was a friend of that barber.
Let's get the barber! We want the barber!
It's the storm troopers!
- Get on the roof.
- No.
- They'll kill you!
- I'll fight.
Don't be a fool, you'll be murdered. Get on the roof.
All right, here we are. Smash in the door!
Come on, we'll give the barber a haircut!
Where are the bombs?
There goes the barbershop!
Never mind. We can start again.
We can go to Osterlich. That's still free.
Mr Jaeckel says it's beautiful.
Wonderful green fields, and they grow apples and grapes.
His brother's got a vineyard.
Mr Jaeckel said he'd take me with him.
Now we can all go together.
It'll be wonderful living in the country, much better than a smoky old city.
And if we work hard and don't eat much, we can save money and buy a chicken farm.
There's money to be made in chickens.
Look at that star!
Isn't it beautiful!
Hynkel with all his power can never touch that.
All right, the coast is clear.
Commander Schultz escaped. He's hiding in my cellar.
He's holding a meeting at midnight and he wants you to be there.
Hannah, you come and help Mrs Jaeckel with the supper.
All right, I'll be down.
I don't understand it. This crazy midnight supper...
What does this Schultz want of us?
- He wants us to blow up the palace. - What?
We Jewish people shouldn't get mixed up in such a business.
I know it but Schultz has them all hypnotised.
- I knew he was up to some mischief.
- Sure he is.
I found him putting a coin in one of your puddings.
Don't worry, I've fixed everything. Wait and see.
Gentlemen, may I claim your indulgence for a moment?
We are here tonight to rid the country of a tyrant.
In order to carry this out one of us must die.
In ancient times the Aryan tribe of the Langobardians made human sacrifice to the god Thor.
At a feast by lottery the victim was chosen.
Tonight, at this feast, one of you will be chosen.
Each man will receive a pudding.
Concealed in one of these is a coin.
Whoever gets it must give up his life but he will join the long line of history's noble martyrs and will rid his country of a tyrant.
I know that it is the wish of all of us to be chosen this night to die for Tomainia.
Much as I should like to participate in this ordeal, I cannot...
Why?
Don't you understand?
He's too well known.
It must be somebody like us.
I can't see it like that.
It is a question of my honour.
It is very embarrassing.
Commander Schultz, I apologise for my friend.
Let me say, on behalf of myself and the others, that we consider it a great privilege to die for our country.
Very well, then.
Gentlemen, I shall now retire until fate has chosen the liberator.
Until then...
Hail Hynk...
What am I saying?
Gentlemen, we have pledged our honour.
Proceed!
Gentlemen, the coin is here!
What's the meaning of this?
Somebody made a fool of us.
- I did.
- What?
I put a coin in every pudding.
Blowing up palaces and wanting to kill people!
We're in enough trouble!
Hannah's right. We've all been foolish.
Our place is at home, looking after our own affairs.
The papers say Schultz may be in the ghetto.
Here, read it for yourself.
Hannah, read that.
"Mystery surrounds the disappearance of ex-Commander Schultz.
"At police HQ it was believed he may be hiding in the ghetto.
"A certain Jewish barber, reported to be a friend of Schultz,
"is wanted for questioning."
Me?
Only for questioning. Not too serious.
Meyerberg was only wanted for questioning. We never saw him again.
- Who is it?
- It's me, Mr Mann.
Did you hear what they're saying about Schultz hiding in the ghetto?
I know, I know.
Don't you think it's serious if they find him in the house?
Don't you realise there are spies everywhere!
Spies?
What's the matter?
He's wanted for questioning.
Where's the Commander?
In the next room.
If Commander Schultz is found in this house, we'll all go to a concentration camp and have our heads cut off, too!
Am I arguing?
Then get rid of him.
You can't throw him out.
Of course not.
But I'd like to know how long he's going to stay here.
Your breakfast is on the table.
Thank you. I haVe breakfast waiting at home.
Search every house.
- What now?
- They're looking for Schultz.
He's in one of these houses.
They're always looking for somebody.
It's me.
Let me in.
The storm troopers are searching every house.
Tell the Commander.
- Did you tell him?
- What is it?
- The storm troopers.
- What?
- You'd both better get on the roof.
We can't leave all these things.
All of you, pack my cases.
You pack that.
Clear this shelf.
Pack this and this.
This mustn't be found.
Open the door.
They're here!
Get up on the roof.
Nothing left behind!
- My golf clubs!
- The hatbox!
- Take this.
- Come on, let's hurry!
- Where are you going?
- With him.
You'll see him later.
- I'll meet you tonight.
- All right.
Take this.
Quick!
Open in the name of Hynkel!
Stop!
Look where you are!
I can't see, wait a moment.
My bag!
It's right here.
Here it is.
Don't drop the other one.
My golf clubs, not my golf clubs!
Come here. They'll see you.
Quick, this way!
Woah, steady!
- Now be careful.
- Yes, sir.
Lucky you didn't break your neck.
You'll pardon me.
I'm sorry.
You guard the back. Wait a minute!
I'll have to bother you again.
There he is.
How are you?
So-so.
Here's your friend.
Your silence will be appreciated.
Take him to the wagon.
Where are you going?
Smoking room.
Come on, this way!
Osterlich!
I am pleased to announce that we are at last ready to march on Osterlich.
This was made possible by the genius of Field Marshal Herring, upon whom I shall now pin a token of my regard.
Turn around. No!
Gentlemen.
To Field Marshal Herring!
To the invasion of Osterlich!
Elephant!
Wait.
Napaloni's army is on the Osterlich front.
60,000 men are on the border.
To take Osterlich!
I can't believe it.
You can't believe it!
You let him steal a march on us.
I had the ground covered.
Declare war on Napaloni!
Mobilise every division of the army and air force.
Attack Bacteria at once!
- But... - Do as I tell you!
- Madness.
- Shut up!
Will you sign this?
What is it?
A declaration of war.
Yes.
A pen!
I'll sign it.
A pen!
I'll sign it! Napaloni...
- It's Napaloni.
- Wait a minute.
Napaloni?
You talk to him.
What'll I say?
Be nice, affable, pleasant.
Well, well, how are you?
No, he hasn't been playing much.
You went round in 92?
His Excellency?
Just now he's a little hoarse.
No, I mean he can't talk.
May I take a message?
He says no doubt you'Ve heard about Osterlich.
He wants to discuss it.
Ask him to come here.
His Excellency invites you to Tomainia to discuss the matter.
Very well. I'll make the arrangements.
He's coming.
Good.
We'll put on the greatest military show the world has ever known.
Napaloni will leave the invasion of Osterlich to me.
And this?
- What is it?
- Your declaration of war.
Peace is declared!
2,975,000 eager citizens are massed in the station square awaiting Benzino Napaloni,
Entering the station is our Phooey, ready to greet his guest,
This will cement the friendship between our Phooey and the Dictator of Bacteria,
His Excellency is about to greet the Bacterian ambassador,
How do you do?
Garbitsch...
See about the photography.
Tell the press to see that our Phooey is well photographed.
- Not the back of his head!
- Yes, sir.
Napaloni's train is coming into the station,
From a pink and white carriage
Napaloni and his wife will step out and Adenoid Hynkel will deliver his address of welcome,
What's all this mix-up-a?
They'Ve gone too far.
At ease!
Bring the carpet.
Why can't-a we get out here?
No-a carpet.
Who cares?
Me, Napaloni, I never get out without a carpet.
Lay it down here.
Quick.
- It's going back.
- What?
Let's get out while it's stopping.
Shut up!
Take it away!
Stay here until they've made up their minds.
You got-a da carpet. Put it down!
Here he is.
- My friend!
- Napaloni!
This is indeed a pleasure.
Welcome to Tomainia.
This way.
Pictures!
Sure. Salute!
Another, please.
This is a pleasure, my friend Hynkel.
You want another?
There.
Where's-a my ambassador?
How do you feel?
Look after mamma.
Hynky, did you meet-a my wife?
That's her.
Let's go.
Tomainia... very nice, very nice.
Your clock is-a slow.
This way.
It's-a very nice people.
The people are very nice.
Thank you.
He's my husband!
You make a mistake!
You make a big-a mistake!
Napaloni's army shall not invade Osterlich. It belongs to me!
We shall not discuss the Osterlich situation.
This interview is to impress on him the force of your personality.
To make him feel your superiority.
Napaloni is aggressive, domineering.
We must put him in his place.
But how?
By means of psychology.
By making him feel inferior.
This can be done subtly.
For instance,
I haVe arranged that he'll be looking up at you, you looking down at him.
His position will be inferior.
Then again we shall seat him here beside your bust so that if you relax that will always be glaring at him.
Where is he now?
Resting.
I have arranged that he will enter from the far end of the room.
Another psychological triumph.
He will have the embarrassment of walking the entire floor.
Signor Napaloni is now leaving his room,
He's coming. Quick, give me a flower.
At all times be above him, before him.
Entering or leaving you must be first.
Hello, Hynky!
How are you feel?
My brother dictate!
You're a nice-a little man. I'm so glad to see you again.
And my friend the Garbitsch!
This is a lovely place.
I feel-a fine.
I just had a nice cold shower.
When you have the plumbing fixed it'll be in good shape.
Won't you sit down?
Well, Hynky, my dictator friend, you.
I must be a-growing!
What do they give me?
A baby stool?
This is not for me. I like it better upstairs.
Garbitsch, this is a lovely country. Very nice-a people.
I thought the public enthusiastic.
Sure. They like to see new faces.
I'm sorry for the mishap that occurred to Madam Napaloni.
What's that?
I'm sorry for the Napaloni that occurred at the... at...
Madam Napaloni at the station.
She's not used to public life. She can't take it.
Match.
I'm sorry...
Don't apologise.
I find-a one.
I'm simply crazy about this palace.
ivory and gold. A lovely combination.
Gets away from that gingerbread idea.
Tell me something, Garbitsch, what's on the programme?
The grand ball this evening.
And a review of the army.
That won't take-a long!
I'm afraid it will.
So you got a big army, huh?
Modesty forbids.
Seems I've heard about it.
I think I'll get me a shave.
We have a barbershop.
Is that so?
You look blue under the gills. What do you say we go together?
- Delighted.
- Good! Very well, this way.
This is it.
I can-a smell 'em.
This is-a very sweet.
It was the library.
A good barbershop.
- Too old-fashioned.
- Is that so?
When I get shaved I like something to look at.
So I'm putting in glass walls.
This way, I shall have a view of the mountains.
And this, a view through the glass ceiling.
- What's above?
- The ballroom.
In my summer palace I haVe a barbershop.
Is that so?
Also with glass walls.
You don't tell me!
With goldfish inside.
Goldfish swimming inside the walls?
How do you feed them?
You can't, they're all dead. That's why I'm building a new one.
- Very interesting!
- You like it?
The Hynkel stadium, Before half a million spectators the greatest ever display of arms marches by in review,
Our beloved Phooey and I'll-Dig-a-Ditchy are seated, thrilled by this historic event,
What?
Nothing.
I'm just chewing.
Some peanuts?
- I'Ve had some.
- Good shape.
Here you are, Spook.
Now passing, Tomainia's heavy artillery,
It's all right.
I want to show you my new bombing planes. They're coming over.
- Where from?
- Aroma.
Aroma?
That's 400 miles away.
Right. I don't know what's detaining them.
Now passing, Tomainia's light artillery,
Very light!
And here come the armoured tanks, the pride of Tomainia's army,
The latest design, the last word in modern warfare,
Where's the propellers?
For going under the water!
Under water?
You never heard of tanks that go under the water and fly up-a stairs?
- What's that?
- Under the water and in the air.
Obsolete now!
We're concentrating on flying dreadnoughts.
- What's that?
- My planes!
Now passing, Hynkel's flying division number 34,
Our planes!
You're right. They're yours.
Garbitsch!
The invasion of Osterlich.
Our troops, tanks and guns will be hidden along the border.
To disarm suspicion, you will go hunting.
Then you will show up at Pretzelburg, meet the army, step into a car and cross over into Osterlich.
Herring and I will be waiting at the capital.
First Napaloni must remove his troops.
To be decided tonight.
Where is Napaloni?
I'll look for him.
It might be advisable for you to dance with Madam Napaloni.
It'll carry weight.
You mean I will!
You find him!
And let me know at once.
- Madam Napaloni...
- Your Excellency!
Why so triste?
Because I no speak.
No? May I haVe the pleasure?
Allow me.
Madam, your dancing was superb.
Excellent.
Very good.
Good.
- My dear Adenoid.
- Benzino!
I've been looking for you.
Let's go to some quiet place where we can talk-a things over.
- As you wish.
- An excellent idea.
To the buffet!
Of course, this way.
There's a Tomainian proverb...
Funny.
I wish I understand it.
Now about the border.
Yes. No problem.
It should be no trouble.
- What's the matter?
- Wait.
You, too. Out!
Out.
- So... the border question.
- Yes.
It's just a matter of detail. Formalities.
Strawberries!
- Have you any English mustard?
- English mustard.
- That's da hot-a stuff?
- Very hot.
Good shape.
Cream.
Hynky, I'm going to make this very simple.
You agree not to invade Osterlich,
I agree not to invade Osterlich.
We sign, then I remove my troops from the border.
When your troops are gone, I sign.
That's-a right.
Just a minute, you don't understand.
First we sign, then I remoVe-a da troops.
- Precisely.
I sign after.
- Just a minute.
Hey, Spook, treaty.
Hold-a dis.
Now, look, you sign-a dis treaty first.
Then I remove my troops after.
Why are we arguing?
You said I remove first.
I can't sign while they're there.
- I won't remove them till you sign.
- Why not?
- Why should I?
- Osterlich is a free country!
Your soldiers are there.
And they'll stay until you sign.
I'll blow them off.
This won't get us anywhere.
To quote an old Latin phrase...
Strawberries!
Where's-a my sandwich?
Another one!
I don't get this treatment in my own joint!
Can't we discuss this without passion?
I'm not-a passionate.
I'm just...
I want him to sign the treaty.
What would my people think, signing such a treaty when your soldiers are on the border?
I won't move until you sign!
Not until you clear the border will I sign!
Then they remain.
Then I kick them off.
One move from you and my artillery will blow you to pieces!
And my aeroplanes will bomb your artillery like that!
You want-a start a world war?
You and the world I'll throw in the ocean!
Strawberries!
Your Excellency, we have...
I got-a my guns here in the pass and I'll blow him to pieces.
What's the matter?
What ails you?
This isn't like you.
Hey, Garbitsch, come here.
What's with Hynky?
Mustard on his strawberries.
What else can you expect from Hynky?
My little bambino!
The Bacterian...
Tomainia...
You cannot treat Bacteria this way.
I'll take the Bacterian people and tear them apart, like this!
Look what he's doing!
It's an insult to my people!
He's-a tearing spaghetti!
He sign-a the treaty or we have a war!
Give me a-something!
Quick, give me a-something!
- I have an appointment.
- What's this?
Press. How's the conference progressing?
Very successfully. How did you get in?
How did he get here?
You know the regulations about reporters.
No one is to enter the palace under any circumstances, understand?
There are minor details to be cleaned up...
Excuse me, we're busy.
The whole world will know we're fighting!
- So what?
- Can't we come to an agreement?
When he signs.
I sign nothing.
I must speak to you alone. Do you mind?
Mind?
I don't mind!
Sign!
Sign!
He'll have the advantage.
It's a mere scrap of paper.
When his troops are off the border, we can move in.
I'll sign.
What?
Hold-a this.
Ah, my little Hynky! My dictator brother!
I knew we haVe-a no trouble.
Two prisoners escaped in officers' uniforms.
Sound the alarm! Two prisoners escaped.
The planes are searching for us.
The woods.
No, the open. The border's that way.
The invasion of Osterlich.
Now or never.
Ducks.
Did you hear that?
It came from over there.
A yodeller. Where did you get that outfit?
- What?
- Don't answer back!
Where's Schultz?
You won't talk, eh?
- He will when we get him to camp. - Come on.
There it is. The village of Pretzelburg.
If we can pass through there we're safe.
Through the woods?
They're swarming with soldiers. They'd suspect us at once.
If you see anyone, don't look right or left.
We must bluff our way through.
Here they come.
Can you see what they're doing?
- Looking this way.
- Keep going!
They're following us. Shall we run?
Certainly not.
Just a little bit?
Keep walking!
We could walk faster.
Make up your mind.
Slow down?
- No!
- There's no hurry.
He's here!
Sound assembly!
Attention!
Present arms!
Turn back?
No, keep going!
Hail Hynkel!
Your Excellency, everything is under control.
- Good.
- Good.
I have been in communication with Marshal Herring in Osterlich.
The route is well guarded. Behind us are 200 tanks, 50 armoured cars and 500 machine-guns.
- Good.
- Good.
Are we ready to start?
- Yes.
- Yes.
Gentlemen.
Schultz, I'm happy you're with us again.
Thank you.
Where are we going?
You're invading Osterlich.
They're coming.
Your Excellency.
The world awaits your words.
What's happened?
He looks strange.
What's Schultz doing here?
Pardoned, I suppose.
His Excellency Herr Garbitsch,
Secretary of the Interior, Minister of Propaganda...
Corona veniet delectis,
Victory shall come to the worthy.
Today, democracy, liberty and equality are words to fool the people.
No nation can progress with such ideas.
They stand in the way of action. Therefore, we abolish them.
In the future, each man will serve the state with absolute obedience.
Let him who refuses beware!
Citizenship will be taken away from all Jews and non-Aryans.
They are inferior and therefore enemies of the state.
It is the duty of all true Aryans to hate and despise them.
This nation is annexed to the Tomainian Empire, and the people will obey the laws bestowed on us by our great leader,
the Dictator of Tomainia, the conqueror of Osterlich, the future Emperor of the World!
You must speak.
I can't.
You must.
It's our only hope.
Hope...
I'm sorry but I don't want to be an emperor.
That's not my business.
I don't want to rule or conquer anyone.
I should like to help everyone:
Jew, gentile, black man, white.
We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that.
We want to live by each other's happiness, not misery.
We don't want to hate one another.
In this world, the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone.
The way of life can be free and beautiful but we have lost the way.
Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into bloodshed.
We have developed speed but have shut ourselves in.
Machinery has left us in want.
Our knowledge has made us cynical, our cleverness, hard and unkind.
We think too much and feel too little.
More than machinery we need humanity.
More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness.
Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost...
The aeroplane and radio have brought us closer.
These inventions cry out for the goodness in man, cry out for universal brotherhood, for the unity of us all.
even now my voice is reaching millions, millions of despairing men, women and children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.
To those who can hear me I say, do not despair.
The misery upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress.
The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took will return to the people.
So long as men die liberty will never perish.
Soldiers, don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you, enslave you, regiment your lives, tell you what to think and feel, who drill you, treat you like cattle and use you as cannon fodder.
Don't give yourselves to these men, machine men with machine minds and machine hearts.
You are not machines, you are not cattle, you are men!
You have the love of humanity in you.
Don't hate. Only the unloved and the unnatural hate.
Soldiers, don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty!
St Luke says, "The Kingdom of God is within man."
Not in one man nor a group of men, but in all men. In you!
You have the power to create machines, the power to create happiness.
You have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.
In the name of democracy, let us use that power.
Let us all unite, let us fight for a new world, a world that will give men a chance to work, that will give youth a future and old age security.
Promising these things, brutes have risen.
But they lie!
They do not fulfil that promise. They never will!
Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people.
Now let us fight to fulfil that promise!
Let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers, to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance.
Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to the happiness of all.
Soldiers, in the name of democracy, let us unite!
Hannah, can you hear me?
wherever you are, look up, Hannah.
The clouds are lifting, the sun is breaking through.
We are coming out of the darkness into a new world, a kindlier world, where men will rise above their hate, their greed and their brutality.
Look up, Hannah.
The soul of man has been given wings.
He is flying into the rainbow, into the light of hope, into the future, the glorious future that belongs to you, to me and to all of us.
Look up, Hannah. Look up!
Did you hear that?
Listen...
Today almost as legendary as Florida's Xanadu the world's largest private pleasure ground.
Here on the deserts of the Gulf Coast, a private mountain was commissioned and successfully built.
One hundred thousand trees, twenty thousand tons of marble are the ingredients of Xanadu's mountain.
Contents of Xanadu's palace:
Paintings, pictures, statues, various stones of other palaces.
A collection of everything.
So big it can never be catalogued or appraised.
Enough for 10 museums, the loot of the world.
Xanadu's livestock the fowl of the air, the fish of the sea, the beast of the field and jungle two of each, the biggest private zoo since Noah.
Like the Pharaohs Xanadu's landlord leaves many stones to mark his grave.
Since the Pyramids Xanadu is the costliest monument a man has built to himself.
A potent figure of our century America's Kubla Khan:
Charles Foster Kane.
Kane's empire, in its glory held dominion over 37 newspapers, two syndicates a radio network, an empire upon an empire.
The first of grocery stores, paper mills apartment buildings, factories, forests, ocean liners.
An empire through which for 50 years flowed in an unending stream the wealth of the Earth's third richest gold mine.
Famed in American legend is the origin of the Kane fortune.
How, to boarding housekeeper Mary Kane, by a defaulting boarder, in 1868 was left the supposedly worthless deed to an abandoned mineshaft:
The Colorado Lode.
Fifty-seven years later, before a congressional investigation Walter P. Thatcher, grand old man of Wall Street for years chief target of Kane papers' attacks on trusts recalls a journey he made as a youth.
My firm had been appointed trustee by Mrs. Kane for a large fortune she recently acquired.
It was her wish that I take charge of this boy, Charles Foster Kane.
Chief, is it not, that on this occasion, Charles Foster Kane personally attacked you after striking you in the stomach with a sled?
I shall read to the committee a prepared statement which I have brought with me, and then refuse to answer questions.
Mr. Charles Foster Kane, in every essence of his social beliefs and by the dangerous manner he has persistently attacked American traditions of private property initiative and opportunity for advancement is, in fact, nothing more or less than a communist.
That same month in Union Square....
The words "Charles Foster Kane" are a menace to every workingman in this land.
He is today what he has always been and always will be: a fascist.
And still another opinion....
Kane urged his country's entry into one war opposed participation in another. Won the election to one American president at least.
Spoke for millions of Americans.
Was hated by as many more.
For 40 years appeared in Kane newsprint no public issue on which Kane papers took no stand.
No public man whom Kane himself did not support or denounce.
Often support, then denounce.
First to a president's niece Emily Norton, who left him in 1916.
Died 1918 in a motor accident with their son.
Sixteen years after his first marriage two weeks after his first divorce Kane married Susan Alexander singer, at the Town Hall in Trenton, New Jersey.
For wife two, one-time opera-singing Susan Alexander Kane built Chicago's Municipal Opera House.
Cost: $3 million.
Conceived for Susan Alexander Kane, half-finished before she divorced him the still unfinished Xanadu.
No man can say.
Kane, molder of mass opinion though he was in all his life was never granted elective office by the voters of his country.
But Kane papers were once strong indeed and once the prize seemed almost his.
In 1916, as independent candidate for governor the best elements of the state behind him the White House seemingly the next easy step in a lightning political career then suddenly, less than one week before election defeat.
Shameful, ignominious.
Defeat that set back for 20 years the cause of reform in the U.S forever cancelled political chances for Charles Foster Kane.
Then, in the first year of the Great Depression a Kane paper closes.
For Kane, in four short years, collapse.
Eleven Kane papers merged, more sold, scrapped.
-Read the Inquirer.
-How were business conditions in Europe?
How did I find business conditions in Europe, Mr. Bones?
With great difficulty.
Are you glad to be back?
Always been an American.
Anything else?
When I was a reporter, we asked them quicker than that.
What do you think of the chances for war in Europe?
I talked with the responsible leaders of England, France, Germany and Italy.
They're too intelligent to embark on a project that would mean the end of civilization.
You can take my word for it, there will be no war.
Kane helped to change the world but Kane's world now is history and the great yellow journalist himself lived to be history outlived his power to make it.
Alone in his never-finished, already decaying pleasure palace aloof, seldom visited, never photographed an emperor of newsprint continued to direct his failing empire.
Vainly attempted to sway, as he once did the destinies of a nation that had ceased to listen to him ceased to trust him.
Then last week, as it must to all men death came to Charles Foster Kane.
News on the March.
I'll tell you if we want to run it again.
-How about it, Mr. Rawlston? -How do you like it, boys? -Seventy years in a man's life.
-That's a lot to try to get into a newsreel.
It's a good short, but what it needs is an angle.
All we saw on that screen was that Charles Foster Kane is dead.
I know that.
I read the papers.
It isn't enough to tell us what a man did you've got to tell us who he was.
Wait a minute.
What were Kane's last words?
Do you remember, boys? What were the last words he said on Earth?
Maybe he told us about himself on his deathbed.
-Maybe he didn't. -All we saw was a big American.
How did he differ from Ford, Hearst or John Doe?
I tell you, a man's dying words--
You don't read the papers. When Charles Foster Kane died, he said one word:
"Rosebud."
That's all he said?
Tough guy. Yes, "Rosebud." Just that one word.
-But who is she?
-What was it?
Here's a man who could've been president who was as loved, hated and talked about as any man in our time, but when he dies something is on his mind called Rosebud.
-What does that mean?
-A racehorse he bet on once.
-That didn't come in.
-But what was the race?
Rosebud. -Thompson. -Yes.
Hold this up a week, two if you must.
Don't you think right after he's dead--
Get in touch with anybody who knew him or knew him well.
That manager of his....
Bernstein. His second wife.
She's still living. Susan Alexander Kane.
-She runs a nightclub in Atlantic City.
See them all.
Get in touch with everybody that ever worked for him whoever loved him, whoever hated his guts.
I don't mean go through the city directory of course.
I'll get on it right away. Good. Rosebud, dead or alive.
It will probably turn out to be a very simple thing.
This is Mr. Thompson, Miss Alexander.
I want another drink, John.
Right away.
-I'll have a highball, please. -Who told you you could sit down?
I thought maybe we could have a talk.
Can't you people leave me alone?
I'm minding my own business, you mind yours.
If I could just have a talk with you, Miss Alexander. I'd--
Get out of here. Get out!
-Maybe some other time.
-Get out.
Get her another highball.
She just won't talk to nobody, Mr. Thompson. Okay.
-Another double?
Hello, I want New York City.
Courtland 79970.
This is Atlantic City 46827.
All right. She's....
Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as any--
-Sooner. This is Thompson. Let me talk to the chief.
Mr. Rawlston? She won't talk.
About Rosebud or anything else.
I'm calling from Atlantic City.
Tomorrow I'll go to Philadelphia, to Thatcher Library, to see his diary.
They're expecting me. Then I've a meeting with his general manager in New York.
Bernstein.
Then I'm coming back here. Yeah, I'll see everybody that's still alive.
Goodbye.
-Hey.... -John. You just might be able to help me.
When she used to talk about Mr. Kane, did she ever mention Rosebud?
"Rosebud"? Thank you, Mr. Thompson, thanks.
As a matter of fact, just the other day, when the papers were full of it I asked her.
She never heard of Rosebud.
The directors of the Thatcher Memorial Library have asked me to remind you about the conditions under which you may inspect certain portions of Mr. Thatcher's unpublished memoirs.
-l remember them. -Yes, Jennings, I'll bring him in.
-All I want is an hour--
-Under no circumstances are direct quotes from his manuscript to be used by you.
You may follow me.
That's all right.
I'm just looking for--
You will be required to leave this room at 4:30 promptly.
You will confine yourself, it is our understanding to the chapters in Mr. Thatcher's manuscript regarding Mr. Kane.
That's all I'm interested in.
Thank you.
Pages 83 to 142.
Be careful, Charles. Mrs. Kane. Pull your muffler around your neck, Charles.
Mrs. Kane, I think we'll have to tell him now.
Yes, I'll sign those papers now, Mr. Thatcher.
You people seem to forget that I'm the boy's father.
It's going to be done exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher.
There's nothing wrong with Colorado.
I don't see why we can't raise our son just 'cause we came into money. If I want to, I can go to court.
A father has a right to.
A boarder that beats his bill and leaves worthless stock behind....
That property is as much my property as anybody's now that it's valuable.
And if Fred Graves had any idea this would happen, he'd have made out the certificates in both our names.
-But they're made out to Mrs. Kane.
-He owed the money to both of us.
-"The bank's decision in all matters--" -l don't hold with giving Charles to a bank--
-Stop this nonsense. -We're a bit uneducated--
"The bank's decision concerning his education...
"...his places of residence, is to be final."
-The idea of a bank being the guardian-- -Stop this nonsense, Jim.
"We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode" which I repeat, Mrs. Kane, you are the sole owner.
-Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher? -Right here.
Mary, I'm asking you for the last time.
You'd think I hadn't been a good husband or father--
The sum of $50,000 a year is to be paid to you and Mr. Kane as long as you both live and thereafter to the survivor.
-Let's hope it's all for the best.
Why I can't raise my own boy is more than I can understand. Go on, Mr. Thatcher.
Everything else, the principal, as well as all monies earned is to be administered by the bank in trust for your son, Charles Foster Kane until he reaches his 25th birthday, at which time he is to come into complete possession.
Charles!
Go on, Mr. Thatcher.
It's almost 5:00.
Don't you think I'd better meet the boy? I've got his trunk all packed.
I've had it packed for a week now.
I'd have brought him here with me, but....
-Charles. -Look, Mom.
You'd better come inside.
-That's quite a snowman.
-l took the pipe out of his mouth.
Did you make it yourself?
.
Maybe I'll make some teeth and whiskers.
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles. -Hello.
-How do you do, Charles?
He comes from the East. -Pa.
-Hello, Charlie.
Charles.
Yes, Mommy.
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight.
You'll be leaving on number 10.
That's the train with all the lights on it. You going, Mom?
No.
Your mother won't be going right away, but she'll....
Where am I going?
You're going to see Chicago and New York and Washington, maybe.
Ain't he? He certainly is.
I wish I were a boy going on a trip like that for the first time.
-Why aren't you coming with us, Mom? -We have to stay here, Charles.
You're gonna live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie.
You're gonna be rich.
Your ma figures, well, that is me and her decided this ain't the place for you to grow up in.
You'll probably be the richest man someday...
-...and you ought to get-- -You won't be lonely.
Lonely, of course not.
We're going to have fine times together, we are.
Let's shake hands. Come. I'm not that frightening, am I?
-What do you say? Let's shake. -Why, Charles.
-Why, you almost hurt me.
Sleds aren't to hit people, but to sleigh with.
Mom! -You got to go.
-Jim!
I'm sorry, Mr. Thatcher.
What the kid needs is a good thrashing. -That's what you think, is it?
-Yes.
That's why he's going to be brought up where you can't get at him.
-...
-Merry Christmas.
And a happy New Year.
In closing may I remind you your 25th birthday, which is now approaching marks your complete independence from the firm of Thatcher Company, as well as acquiring the full responsibility for the world's sixth largest private fortune.
-Got that?
-"The world's sixth largest private fortune."
I don't think you realize the full importance of the position you are to occupy.
I am therefore enclosing for your consideration a list of your holdings, extensively cross-indexed.
-"Dear Mr. Thatcher."
-It's from Mr. Kane.
-Go on. -"Sorry, I'm not interested in gold mines...
"...oil wells, shipping or real estate."
Not interested?
"One item on your list intrigues me:
The New York Inquirer. "A little newspaper we acquired in a foreclosure proceeding.
"Don't sell it. I am coming back to take charge.
"l think it would be fun to run a newspaper.
"Traction Trust bleeds public white."
"Traction Trust smashed by Inquirer."
"Landlords refuse to clear slums."
"Inquirer wins slum fight."
"Wall Street backs copper swindle."
"Copper robbers indicted." "Galleons of Spain off Jersey Coast."
Is that really your idea of how to run a newspaper?
I don't know how to run a newspaper.
I try everything I can think of. You know there's not the slightest proof this...
-... Armada's off the Jersey Coast. -Hello, Mr. Bernstein.
Can you prove it isn't?
Mr. Bernstein, I'd like you to meet Mr. Thatcher.
-Mr. Leland. -Hello.
Mr. Thatcher, my ex-guardian.
We have no secrets from our readers.
Thatcher is one of our devoted readers. He knows what's wrong with every copy of the Inquirer since I took over.
Read. "Girls delightful in Cuba. Stop.
Could send you prose poems...
"...about scenery but don't feel right spending your money.
"There is no war in Cuba." Signed "Wheeler." Any answer? Yes.
Dear Wheeler:
You provide the prose poems, I'll provide the war.
-That's fine. -l like it myself.
Send it right away.
I came to see you about this campaign of yours.
The Inquirer's campaign against the Public Transit Company.
Do you know anything we can use against them?
You're still the college boy, eh?
I was expelled from college, a lot of colleges, you remember?
I remember.
I think I should remind you of a fact you have forgotten.
You're one of the largest stockholders in the Public Transit Company.
The trouble is, you don't realize you're talking to two people.
As Charles Foster Kane who owns 82,364 shares of Public Transit Preferred.
See, I do have a general idea of my holdings.
I sympathize with you.
Kane is a scoundrel his paper should be closed, a committee formed to boycott him.
If you can form such a committee, put me down for a contribution of $1,000.
On the other hand, I am the publisher of the Inquirer.
As such it's my duty, I'll let you in on a little secret.
It is also my pleasure to see that the working people of this community aren't robbed by a pack of money-mad pirates, just because they have no one to look after their interests.
I'll let you in on another little secret, Mr. Thatcher:
I think I'm the man to do it.
You see, I have money and property.
If I don't look after the interests of the underprivileged, somebody else will. Maybe somebody without money or property.
That would be too bad.
I saw your financial statement today.
-Oh, did you?
-Tell me, honestly don't you think it's rather unwise to continue this philanthropic enterprise this Inquirer, that is costing you $1 million a year?
Yes.
I did lose $1 million last year.
I expect to lose $1 million this year. I expect to lose $1 million next year.
At the rate of $1 million a year I'll have to close this place in 60 years.
"With respect to the said newspapers... "...the said Charles Foster Kane...
"...hereby relinquishes all control thereof...
"...and of the syndicates pertaining thereto...
"...and any and all other newspaper, press and publishing properties of any kind...
"...and agrees to abandon all claim thereto--"
-Which means we're bust all right.
-Well, out of cash.
All right, Mr. Bernstein.
I've read it, Mr. Thatcher, just let me sign it and go home.
You're too old to call me Mr. Thatcher, Charles. You're too old to be called anything else.
You were always too old.
"In consideration thereof, Thatcher Company agrees...
"...to pay to Charles Foster Kane, as long as he lives--" My allowance.
"You will continue to maintain over your newspapers a large...
"...measure of control. Measure of control."
And we shall seek your advice.
This depression is temporary.
There's always the chance that you'll die richer than I will. It's a cinch I'll die richer than I was born.
We never lost as much as we made.
Yes, yes, but your methods.
You know, Charles you never made a single investment.
You always used money to....
To buy things.
To buy things.
My mother should have chosen a less reliable banker.
I always gagged on that silver spoon.
You know, Mr. Bernstein if I hadn't been very rich I might have been a really great man.
Don't you think you are?
I think I did pretty well under the circumstances.
What would you like to have been?
Everything you hate.
I beg your pardon, sir? What did you say?
-It's 4:30.
Isn't it, Jennings? -Yes, ma'am.
You have enjoyed a very rare privilege, young man.
-Did you find what you were looking for?
-You're not Rosebud, are you? -What?
Rosebud, and your name is Jennings, isn't it?
Goodbye, everybody.
Thanks for the use of the hall. Who's a busy man, me?
I'm chairman of the board.
I got nothing but time.
What do you want to know? We thought maybe....
If we could find out what he meant by his last words...
-...as he was dying.
-That "Rosebud"?
Maybe some girl?
There were a lot of them in the early days.
It's hardly likely that Mr. Kane could have met someone casually and then 50 years later, on his deathbed--
Well, you're pretty young, Mr. Thompson.
A fellow will remember a lot of things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me.
One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on the ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in and on it there was a girl waiting to get off.
A white dress she had on.
She was carrying a white parasol. I only saw her for one second.
She didn't see me at all, but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.
-Who else have you been to see?
-Well, I went down to Atlantic City.
Susie? Thank you.
I called her myself the day after he died.
I thought maybe somebody ought to.
-She couldn't even come to the phone. -I'll be seeing her again in a couple of days.
About Rosebud, Mr. Bernstein.
If you'd talk about anything connected with Mr. Kane that you can remember.
You were with him from the beginning.
From before the beginning, young fellow. And now it's after the end.
Have you tried to see anybody except Susie?
I haven't seen anybody else, but I've been through Walter Thatcher's journal.
-That man was the biggest fool I ever met.
-He made an awful lot of money.
Well, it's no trick to make a lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money.
You take Mr. Kane. It wasn't money he wanted.
Thatcher never did figure him out. Sometimes even I couldn't.
You know who you ought to see? Mr. Leland.
He was Mr. Kane's closest friend. They went to school together.
Harvard?
Oh, Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Cornell, Switzerland.
He was thrown out of a lot of colleges.
Mr. Leland never had a nickel.
One of those families where the father is worth $10 million then one day he shoots himself, and it turns out there's nothing but debts.
He was with Mr. Kane and me the first day Mr. Kane took over the Inquirer.
Take a good look at it, Jedediah.
It's going to look a lot different one of these days. Come on.
There ain't no bedrooms in this joint. That's a newspaper building.
You're getting paid, mister, for opinions or for hauling?
-Jedediah.
-After you, Mr. Kane.
Excuse me, sir, but I....
Welcome, Mr. Kane.
Welcome to the Inquirer, Mr. Kane.
I am Herbert Carter, the editor-in-chief.
-Thank you, Mr. Carter. This is Mr. Leland--
-How do you do, Mr. Leland?
Our new dramatic critic. I hope I haven't made a mistake.
-It is dramatic critic, right?
-That's right.
-Are they standing for me? -You?
Oh, Mr. Kane.
Standing?
-How do you do?
-How do you do?
I thought it would be a nice little gesture.
-Ask them to sit down, will you, please.
-The new publisher.
-You may resume your duties, gentlemen. -Thank you.
-l didn't know your plans.
-l don't know my plans myself.
-Matter of fact, I haven't got any plans. -No?
Except to get out a newspaper.
-Mr. Bernstein.
-Yes, Mr. Kane.
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. -Mr.
Bernstein is my general manager. -How do you do, Mr. Carter?
-Mr. Carter.
-How do you do?
-Yes, Mr. Bernstein. -Stein.
-Kane.
-Mr.
Carter, is this your office?
My little private sanctum is at your disposal. -Excuse me.
-But I don't think I understand.
Mr. Carter, I'm going to live right here in your office as long as I have to.
Live here?
Yes?
-Excuse me.
-But a morning newspaper, after all--
We're practically closed for 12 hours a day.
That's one of the things that's going to have to be changed here.
-The news goes on for 24 hours a day. -24?
-That's right.
-Excuse me.
It's impossible....
I've drawn that cartoon. I'm no good as a cartoonist.
You certainly aren't.
You're the dramatic critic, Leland. -You still eating?
-I'm still hungry.
Here's a front-page story in the Chronicle about a Mrs. Harry Silverstone in Brooklyn who's missing.
She's probably murdered.
Why isn't there something about it in the Inquirer?
We're running a newspaper...
-I'm absolutely starving to death.
-...not a scandal sheet.
That's all right.
Mr. Carter, here is a three-column headline in the Chronicle.
Why hasn't the Inquirer a three-column headline?
The news wasn't big enough.
Mr. Carter, if the headline is big enough, it makes the news big enough. -That's right!
-The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone--
There's no proof that she was murdered, or dead.
It says she's missing. The neighbors are getting suspicious.
It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.
If we were interested in that kind of thing, we could fill the paper twice over, daily.
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on.
I want you to send your best man to see Mr. Silverstone.
Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife, Mrs. Silverstone the Inquirer will have him arrested.
Tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from....
-Central Office.
-The Central Office.
If Mr. Silverstone gets suspicious and asks to see your man's badge your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist.
Loudly, so the neighbors can hear. You ready for dinner, Jedediah?
I can't see that the function of a respectable newspaper--
Thank you so much, Mr. Carter. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Paper! Read all about it!
Read all about it in the early morning Chronicle.
The mystery of the lady that vanished in Brooklyn.
Read all about it in the early morning Chronicle.
We'll be on the street soon, Charlie, another 10 minutes.
Three hours and 50 minutes late, but we did it.
-Tired?
-A tough day.
-A wasted day. -Wasted?
You only made the paper over four times tonight, that's all.
I've changed the front page a little, Mr. Bernstein. That's not enough.
There's something I've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print.
I've got to make the New York Inquirer as important to New York as the gas in that light.
What are you going to do, Charlie?
My Declaration of Principles.
Don't smile, Jedediah.
I've got it all written out here.
You don't want to make any promises you don't want to keep.
These'll be kept.
"I'll provide the people of this city...
"...with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.
-"l will also provide--"
-That's two sentences starting with "l."
People will know who's responsible and they'll get the truth in the Inquirer, quickly, simply and entertainingly.
No special interests will be allowed to interfere with that truth.
"l will also provide them with a fighting and tireless champion of their rights...
"...as citizens and as human beings."
Signed:
"Charles Foster Kane."
-Can I have that, Charlie?
-I'm going to print it.
Solly!
Yes, Mr. Kane?
I want you to run this editorial in a box on the front page.
This morning's front page?
That's right, Solly, that means we'll have to remake again.
-Yes. -Go down and tell them.
All right.
When you're through with that, I'd like to have it back.
I'd like to keep that particular piece of paper myself.
I have a hunch it might turn out to be something pretty important.
-A document...
-Sure.
...like the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and my first report card at school.
I know you're tired, gentlemen, but I brought you here for a reason.
-This little pilgrimage will do us good.
-The Chronicle's a good newspaper.
Chronicle's a good idea for a newspaper. Notice the circulation. 495,000.
But look who's working for the Chronicle.
-With them, it's no trick to get circulation. -You're right.
You know how long it took the Chronicle to get that staff together?
-Twenty years.
-Twenty years?
Six years ago, I looked at a picture of the world's greatest newspaper men.
I felt like a kid in front of a candy store.
Tonight, six years later, I got my candy, all of it.
Welcome, gentlemen, to the Inquirer.
Make an extra copy of that picture and mail it to the Chronicle.
It'll make you all happy to learn that our circulation this morning was the greatest in New York: 684,000.
684,132. Right.
I hope you'll forgive my rudeness in taking leave of you.
I'm going abroad next week for a vacation.
I've promised my doctor for sometime that I would leave when I could.
I now realize I can't.
Say, Mr. Kane, as long as you're promising there's a lot of pictures and statues in Europe you ain't bought yet.
You can't blame me, Mr. Bernstein.
They've been making statues for 2,000 years.
And I've only been buying for five. -Promise me, Mr. Kane.
-l promise, Mr. Bernstein.
-Thank you.
-Mr. Bernstein?
You don't expect me to keep any of those promises, do you?
And now, gentlemen!
Your complete attention, if you please.
Are we going to declare war on Spain?
Oh, mama, here they come. Shoot me while I'm happy.
I said, "Are we going to declare war on Spain, or are we not?"
The Inquirer already has.
You long-faced, overdressed anarchist.
I'm not overdressed. You are, too.
Mr. Bernstein, look at his necktie.
Let's have the song about Charlie.
-Is there a song about Charlie?
-Is there a song about you, Mr. Kane?
You buy a bag of peanuts in this town, you get a song written about you.
I've seen that fellow. He's good.
Good evening, Mr. Kane.
"There is a man, a certain man
"And for the poor you may be sure that he'll do all he can
"Who is this one?
This favorite son
"Just by his action has the traction magnates on the run
"Who loves to smoke, enjoys a joke
"Who wouldn't get a bit upset if he were really broke
"With wealth and fame he's still the same
"I'll bet you $5 you're not alive if you don't know his name
"What is his name?
"It's Charlie Kane, it's Mister Kane!
"He doesn't like that Mister He likes good old Charlie Kane"
-isn't it wonderful?
Such a party.
-Yes.
What's the matter?
"Who says a miss was made to kiss
"And when he meets one always tries to do exactly this
"Who buys the food, who buys the drinks
"Who thinks that dough was made to spend and acts the way he thinks
"Now is it, Joe, no, no, no"
Bernstein, these men who are now with the Inquirer who were with the Chronicle until yesterday--
Oh, mama, please.
-Give me that.
-What?
The blonde?
-No, the brunette.
-Where did you learn that, Charlie?
Bernstein, these men who were with the Chronicle weren't they just as devoted to the Chronicle policy as they are now to our policies?
Sure, they're just like anybody else.
They got work to do, they do it.
Only they happen to be the best men in the business.
Do we stand for the same things the Chronicle stands for?
Certainly not.
Listen, Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.
There's always a chance, of course, that they'll change Mr. Kane.
Without his knowing it.
Mr. Leland, I got a cable from Mr. Kane!
-l got a cable here from Mr. Kane.
-What?
-From Paris, France.
-What? -From Paris, France.
-Come on in.
"Who by his action has the traction magnates on the run"
It's a good thing he promised not to send back any more statues.
Look, he wants to buy the world's biggest diamond.
Why didn't you go to Europe with him?
He wanted you to. I wanted Charlie to have fun, with me along....
Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt?
Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?
Am I a New England schoolmarm?
Yes.
If you thought I'd answer you different from what Mr. Kane tells you, I wouldn't.
"World's biggest diamond."
I didn't know Charlie was collecting diamonds.
He ain't.
He's collecting somebody that's collecting diamonds.
Anyway, he ain't only collecting statues.
"Welcome home, Mr. Kane...
"...from 467 employees of the New York Inquirer."
Here he comes!
Welcome, Mr. Kane.
-l know I've a moustache.
Have we got a society editor?
-Right here, Mr. Kane.
-Miss Townsend is the society editor.
Miss Townsend, this is Mr. Charles Foster Kane.
Miss Townsend, I've been away so long. I don't know your routine.
I got a little social announcement.
I wish you wouldn't treat this any differently than you would any other social announcement.
Mr. Kane, on behalf of all the employees of the Inquirer--
Mr. Bernstein, thank you very much, everybody, I....
I'm sorry, I can't accept it now.
Goodbye.
Say, he was in an awful hurry.
Hey, everybody, look out here.
Let's go to the window.
-Mr. Leland!
Mr. Bernstein!
-Yes, Ms. Townsend?
This announcement:
"Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Monroe Norton...
"...announce the engagement of their daughter, Emily Monroe Norton...
"...to Mr. Charles Foster Kane."
Emily Monroe Norton, she's the niece of the President of the United States.
President's niece?
Before he's through, she'll be a president's wife.
The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you.
Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud.
It didn't end very well, did it?
Then there was Susie. That ended, too.
You know, Mr. Thompson, I was thinking this Rosebud you're trying to find out about....
Yes?
Maybe that was something he lost.
Mr. Kane was a man who lost almost everything he had.
You ought to see Jed Leland.
Of course, he and Mr. Kane didn't exactly see eye to eye.
You take the Spanish-American war.
I guess Mr. Leland was right.
That was Mr. Kane's war. We didn't really have anything to fight about.
Do you think if it hadn't been for that war of Mr. Kane's we'd have the Panama Canal?
I wish I knew where Mr. Leland was.
A lot of the time now they don't tell me these things.
Maybe even he's dead.
In case you'd like to know he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
You don't say.
I had-- Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me, just....
Just old age.
It's the only disease that you don't look forward to being cured of.
I can remember absolutely everything, young man.
That's my curse. That's one of the greatest curses ever inflicted on the human race: memory.
I was his oldest friend, and as far as I was concerned, he behaved like a swine.
Not that Charlie was ever brutal. He just did brutal things.
Maybe I wasn't his friend, but if I wasn't, he never had one.
Maybe I was what you nowadays call a stooge.
You were about to say something about Rosebud.
Do you happen to have a good cigar? I've got a young physician here who thinks I'm going to give up smoking.
No, I'm afraid I haven't.
Sorry.
I changed the subject, didn't I? What a disagreeable old man I have become.
You're a reporter and you want to know what I think about Charlie Kane.
I suppose he had some private sort of greatness.
But he kept it to himself. He never gave himself away.
He never gave anything away. He just left you a tip.
He had a generous mind.
I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions.
But he never believed in anything except Charlie Kane.
He never had a conviction except Charlie Kane in his life.
I suppose he died without one.
That must have been pretty unpleasant.
Of course, a lot of us check out without having any special convictions about death.
But we do know what we're leaving.
We do believe in something. Are you absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?
-Sorry, Mr. Leland.
-Never mind.
-What do you know about Rosebud?
-"Rosebud"?
His dying words: "Rosebud."
I saw that in the Inquirer.
I never believed anything I saw in the Inquirer.
Anything else?
I can tell you about Emily.
I went to dancing school with Emily.
I was very graceful. -We were talking about the first Mrs. Kane.
-What was she like?
She was like all the girls I knew in dancing school.
After the first couple of months she and Charlie didn't see much of each other except at breakfast.
It was a marriage just like any other marriage.
-You're beautiful.
You're very beautiful. I've never been to six parties in one night before.
-I've never been up this late.
-It's a matter of habit.
-What will the servants think?
-That we enjoyed ourselves.
Why do you have to go straight off to the newspaper? You never should've married a newspaperman, they're worse than sailors.
I absolutely adore you.
Charles, even newspapermen have to sleep.
I'll call Mr. Bernstein and have him put off my appointments till noon.
What time is it?
It's early.
Charles....
Do you know how long you kept me waiting last night when you went to the newspaper for 10 minutes?
What do you do in a newspaper in the middle of the night?
My dear, your only correspondent is the Inquirer.
Sometimes I think I'd prefer a rival of flesh and blood. I don't spend that much time on the newspaper.
It isn't just the time.
It's what you print, attacking the President.
-You mean Uncle John.
-l mean the President of the United States.
He's still Uncle John and a well-meaning fathead who's letting a pack of high-pressure crooks run his administration.
-This whole oil scandal--
-He happens to be the President, not you.
That's a mistake that will be corrected one of these days. Your Mr. Bernstein sent Junior the most incredible atrocity yesterday.
I simply can't have it in the nursery.
Mr. Bernstein is apt to pay a visit to the nursery now and then.
Does he have to?
Yes.
-Really, Charles, people will think--
Wasn't he ever in love with her?
He married for love.
Love.
That is why he did everything. That's why he went into politics.
It seems we weren't enough. He wanted all the voters to love him, too.
All he wanted out of life was love.
That's Charlie's story.
How he lost it. You see, he just didn't have any to give.
He loved Charlie Kane, of course.
Very dearly.
And his mother, I guess he always loved her.
-How about his second wife?
-Susan Alexander?
You know what Charlie called her?
The day after he'd met her, he told me about her. He said she was "a cross-section of the American public."
I guess he couldn't help it.
She must have had something for him.
That first night, according to Charlie all she had was a toothache.
What are you laughing at, young lady?
-What's the matter with you?
-Toothache. -What?
You mean you've got a toothache.
-What's funny about that?
-You're funny, mister.
-You've got dirt on your face.
-Not dirt, it's mud.
Do you want some hot water? I live right here.
What's that, young lady?
I said, if you wanted some hot water I could get you some...hot water.
Do I look any better now?
-This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
Excuse me, but my landlady prefers me to keep this door open...
-...when I have a gentleman caller.
You have got a toothache, haven't you?
-l surely have.
-Why don't you try laughing at me again?
-What? -I'm still pretty funny.
I know, but you don't want me to laugh at you.
I don't want your tooth to hurt, either.
Look at me.
See that? What are you doing?
That's it, smile. It took me two solid years at the best boys' school in the world to learn that.
The fellow who taught me is now president of Venezuela.
-Is it a giraffe?
-No, not a giraffe.
-l bet it is.
-What?
Well, then it's an elephant. -It's supposed to be a rooster.
-A rooster! You know an awful lot of tricks.
Are you a professional magician?
-No, I'm not a magician.
-l was just joking.
You really don't know who I am? You told me your name, Mr. Kane, but I'm awfully ignorant.
I guess you caught on to that. I bet I've heard your name a million times.
You really like me, though, even though you don't know who I am?
I surely do.
You've been wonderful. Without you I don't know what I would have done.
I had a toothache, and I don't know many people.
I know too many people.
I guess we're both lonely. Want to know what I was going to do before I ruined my best Sunday clothes?
I bet they're not your best Sunday clothes.
I was on my way to the Western Manhattan Warehouse in search of my youth.
You see, my mother died a long time ago.
Her things were put in storage out West.
There wasn't any other place to put them. I thought I'd send for them now. Tonight I was going to take a look at them.
A sort of sentimental journey.
I run a couple of newspapers.
What do you do? Me?
-How old did you say you were?
-l didn't say.
If you had, I wouldn't have asked you.
-Pretty old. -How old?
-Twenty-two in August.
That's a ripe old age. What do you do? I work at Seligman's.
I'm in charge of the sheet music.
-Is that what you want to do? -No, I wanted to be a singer, I guess.
-That is, I didn't.
My mother did for me. -What happened to the singing? Mother always thought, she always talked about grand opera for me.
Imagine. But my voice isn't that kind.
-Have you got a piano?
-A piano?
Yes, there's one in the parlor.
-Would you sing for me?
-You wouldn't want to hear me sing.
Yes, I would.
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you.
No, that's all gone. All right.
Let's go to the parlor.
There is only one man who can rid the politics of this state of the evil domination of Boss Jim Gettys.
I am speaking of Charles Foster Kane, the fighting liberal the friend of the workingman, the next governor of this state who entered upon this campaign. with one purpose only:
To point out and make public the dishonesty the downright villainy of Boss Jim W. Gettys' political machine now in complete control of the government of this state.
I made no campaign promises because, until a few weeks ago, I had no hope of being elected.
Now, however, I have something more than a hope.
Jim Gettys has something less than a chance.
Every straw vote every independent poll shows that I will be elected.
Very well.
The workingman and the slum child know they can expect my best efforts in their interests.
The decent, ordinary citizens know that I'll do everything in my power to protect the underprivileged, the underpaid, and the underfed.
-Mother, is Pop governor yet?
I'd make my promises now if I weren't too busy arranging to keep them.
But here's one promise I'll make and Boss Jim Gettys knows I'll keep it.
My first official act as governor of this state will be to appoint a special district attorney to arrange for the indictment prosecution and conviction of Boss Jim W. Gettys.
If the election were held today, you'd be in by 100,000 votes.
-Gettys isn't even pretending.
-Hello, son.
It's beginning to dawn on Jim Gettys I mean what I say.
-Did you like your old man's speech?
-l could hear every word.
-Hello, Emily.
-Hold it.
-Great speech, Mr. Kane. -Wonderful.
Will you get us a taxi?
I'm sending Junior home in the car with Oliver.
Good night, Father.
Why did you send Junior home in the car?
What are you doing in a taxi?
There's a call I want you to make with me.
-It can wait.
-No, it can't. What's this all about, Emily?
It may not be about anything at all.
I intend to find out. -Where are you going?
-I'm going to "185 West 74th Street."
I had no idea you had this flair for melodrama, Emily.
He forced me to send your wife that letter. I didn't want to.
Mrs. Kane.
I don't suppose anybody would introduce us.
I'm Jim Gettys.
I made Miss Alexander send you the note, Mrs. Kane.
She didn't want to at first.
Charlie, the things he said to me.... He threatened to-- I won't wait until I'm elected.
To start with, I think I'll break your neck.
Maybe you can do it, and maybe you can't.
Your breaking this man's neck would scarcely explain this note:
"Serious consequences for Mr. Kane, for yourself and for your son."
-He wanted to get her to come here--
-What does this note mean?
I'm Susan Alexander.
I know what you're thinking--
-What does this note mean, Ms. Alexander? -She don't know.
She sent it because I told her it wouldn't be smart not to.
-Emily, this gentleman-- -I'm not a gentleman.
Your husband is only trying to be funny calling me one.
I don't even know what a gentleman is.
You see, my idea of a gentleman....
If I owned a paper and didn't like the way somebody was doing things some politician, I'd fight him with all I had.
I wouldn't show him in a convict suit so his family could see his picture in the paper.
-You're a cheap, crooked grafter--
-We're talking now about what you are.
I'm fighting for my life, not just my political life.
-He said unless you-- -That's what I said. Here's the chance I'm willing to give him.
It's more of a chance than he'd give me.
Unless he decides by tomorrow that he's so sick he has to go away for a year Monday morning, all papers in the state, except his, will carry the story I'll give.
What story?
-The story about him and Ms. Alexander.
-There isn't any story! Shut up.
We've got evidence that would look bad in the headlines.
Do you want me to give you the evidence?
I'd rather he withdrew without having the story published.
Not that I care about him, but I'd be better off that way.
So would you, Mrs. Kane.
What about me? He said my name would be dragged through the mud.
That everywhere I went--
There seems to be only one decision you can make, Charles.
I'd say that it'd been made for you.
You can't tell me the voters of this state--
I'm not interested in the voters of this state right now.
I am interested in our son.
-Charlie, if they publish this story-- -They won't.
Are you coming, Charles?
I'm staying here.
I can fight this all alone.
If you don't listen to reason, it may be too late.
For what?
For you and this public thief to take the love of the people away from me?
You got other things to think about.
Your little boy. You don't want him to read about you in the papers.
And that's me.
You're making a bigger fool of yourself than I thought.
-I've got nothing to say to you. -You're licked--
Get out. If you want to see me, have the warden write me a letter.
If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you.
Only you're going to need more than one lesson.
-And you'll get more than one lesson.
Don't worry about me!
I'm Charles Foster Kane!
I'm no cheap, crooked politician trying to save himself from the consequences of his crimes!
Gettys!
I'm gonna send you to Sing Sing.
Sing Sing, Gettys.
-Have you a car, Mrs. Kane?
-Yes, thank you.
Paper.
With a million majority already against him and the church counties still to be heard from I'm afraid we got no choice.
This one?
-Is there anything I can-- -No, thanks, Mr. Bernstein.
You better go home and get some sleep.
You, too.
-I'm drunk.
If you've got drunk to talk to me about Ms. Alexander, don't bother.
I'm not interested.
I've set back the sacred cause of reform, is that it?
All right.
If that's the way they want it, the people have made their choice.
It's obvious the people prefer Jim Gettys to me.
You talk about the people as though you owned them.
As though they belong to you. Goodness.
As long as I can remember, you've talked about giving the people their rights as if you could make them a present of liberty as a reward for services rendered.
-Jed. -You remember the workingman?
I'll get drunk, too, Jedediah if it'll do any good.
It won't do any good. Besides you never get drunk.
You used to write an awful lot about the workingman--
He's turning into something called "organized labor."
You won't like that one little bit when you find out it means your workingman expects something as his right, and not your gift.
When your precious underprivileged really get together....
Oh, boy....
That'll add up to something bigger than your privilege then I don't know what you'll do.
Sail away to a desert island probably and lord it over the monkeys.
I wouldn't worry about it too much.
There'll probably be a few of them there to tell me when I do something wrong.
You may not always be so lucky.
You're not very drunk.
Drunk, what do you care?
You don't care about anything except you.
You persuade people that you love them so much that they ought to love you back.
Only you want love on your own terms.
-Let me work on the Chicago paper.
-What?
You said you were looking for someone to do dramatic "crimitism," criticism.
I am drunk.
I want to go to Chicago.
You're too valuable here.
-There's nothing left for me to do--
-All right, you can go to Chicago. Thank you.
I guess I'd better try to get drunk anyway.
I warn you, Jedediah, you won't like Chicago.
The wind comes off the lake, and they've probably never heard of Lobster Newburg.
Will Saturday after next be all right?
A toast to love on my terms.
Those are the only terms anybody knows:
-What's that, young man?
Am I through with politics?
I would say vice versa.
We're going to be an opera star.
Are you singing at the Metropolitan? We certainly are.
Charlie said if I didn't, he'd build me an opera house.
Mr. Leland is writing it from the dramatic angle?
-And we've covered it from the news end.
-And the social.
How about the music notice? Yes, it's already made up.
Mr. Mowan wrote a swell review.
-Enthusiastic?
Mr. Kane. This is a surprise.
We've got two spreads of pictures. The music notice on the front page?
But there's still one notice to come.
The dramatic notice.
-Yes, we're waiting for it.
Mr. Leland and Mr. Kane haven't spoken together for years.
Close the door.
He ain't been drinking before.
Never. We would have heard.
What does it say there?
The notice, what's he written? "Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur...
"...
last night opened the new Chicago Opera House...
I still can't pronounce that name.
"Her singing, happily, is no concern of this department.
"Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to...."
Go on.
Of her acting it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that, in the opinion of this reviewer, it represents a new low.
-In the opinion of this reviewer.
-l didn't see that. It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein, I'm dictating it.
Kane, l-- -Get me a typewriter.
-Hello, Mr. Leland.
Where's my notice, Bernstein?
I've got to finish my notice.
Charlie out there?
I guess he's fixing it up.
I knew I'd never get that through.
Mr. Kane's finishing your review just the way you started it.
He's writing a bad notice like you wanted it to be.
Hello, Jedediah.
Hello, Charlie.
I didn't know we were speaking.
Sure we're speaking, Jedediah.
Everybody knows that story, Mr. Leland, but why did he do it?
-How could a man write a notice-- -You just don't know Charlie.
He thought that by finishing that notice he'd show me he was an honest man.
He was always trying to prove something.
That whole thing about Susie being an opera singer.
That was trying to prove something.
You know what the headline was the day before the election?
"Candidate Kane found in love nest with 'singer."'
He was going to take the quotes off the singer. Hey, nurse!
Five years ago he wrote from that place down there in the South.
What's it called, Shangri-la?
Sloppy Joe's? What's the name?
All right, Xanadu, I knew it all the time.
You caught on, didn't you?
I'm not that hard to see through.
Well, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have.
I guess he was pretty lonely down there in that coliseum all those years.
He hadn't finished it when she left him.
He never finished it.
He never finished anything except my notice.
-Of course, he built the joint for her. -That must have been love. I don't know.
He was disappointed in the world so he built his own, an absolute monarchy.
It was something bigger than an opera house anyway. -Nurse.
-Yes, Mr. Leland. I'm coming.
-There's one thing you can do for me. -Sure.
Stop at the cigar store on your way out, and get me a couple of good cigars.
-Be glad to. -Thank you. One is enough.
When I was a young man, there was an impression that nurses were pretty.
Well, it was no truer then than it is today.
-I'll take your arm.
-All right. -You won't forget about those cigars? -l won't.
Have them wrapped like toothpaste, or they'll stop them at the desk.
You know that young doctor I was telling you about, well he's got an idea he wants to keep me alive.
Anything that comes into your mind about yourself and Mr. Kane.
You don't want to hear what comes into my mind about myself and Charlie Kane.
You know, maybe I shouldn't have sung for Charlie that first time I met him.
But I did an awful lot of singing after that.
I sang for teachers at $100 an hour.
-The teachers got that, I didn't.
-What did you get?
I didn't get a thing, except music lessons. That's all there was in it.
He married you, didn't he?
He didn't mention anything about marriage until after it was over and until it got in the papers about us and he lost the election, and that Norton woman divorced him.
He was really interested in my voice.
I didn't want it. I didn't want a thing.
Everything was his idea except my leaving him.
Don't get nervous. Please. Let's come back.
You're out of pitch.
Some people can sing.
Some can't.
It's not your job to give your opinion of Mrs. Kane's talents.
You're supposed to train her voice, Signor Matiste.
Nothing more.
Please continue with the lesson. -But, Mr. Kane.
-Please. I'll be the laughingstock of the musical world.
People will think-- You're concerned what people will think?
Perhaps I can enlighten you a bit.
I'm an authority on what people will think.
The newspapers for example.
I run several newspapers between here and San Francisco.
It's all right, darling.
Signor Matiste is going to listen to reason.
"Oh Dieux, arrachez-moi
Stop telling me he's your friend.
A friend don't write that kind of review.
All these other papers panning me, I could expect that.
But for the Inquirer to run a thing like that, spoiling my whole debut.
I'll get it. Friend.
Not the kind of friends I know but I'm not high class like you.
And I never went to any swell schools.
That'll be enough, Susan. From Mr. Leland, sir.
He wanted me to make sure you got this personally.
Is that something from him?
Charlie!
As for you, you ought to have your head examined.
Sending him a letter telling him he's fired with a $25,000 check in it.
What kind of firing do you call that?
You did send him a check for $25,000, didn't you?
Yes.
I sent him a check for $25,000.
What's that?
Declaration of Principles.
An antique. You're awful funny, aren't you?
I'll tell you one thing you're not going to be funny about, and that's my singing.
I'm through. I never wanted to do it in the first place.
You'll continue with your singing, Susan.
I don't propose to have myself made ridiculous.
You don't propose to have yourself made ridiculous!
What about me?
I'm the one that has to sing.
I'm the one that gets the raspberries.
Why don't you leave me alone?
My reasons satisfy me, Susan. You seem unable to understand them.
I will not tell them to you again.
Susan.
She'll be perfectly all right in a day or two, Mr. Kane.
I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a foolish mistake.
The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her was in a somewhat larger bottle.
The strain of preparing for the new opera has excited and confused her.
Yes, I'm sure that was it.
No objections to my staying with her are there?
No, not at all.
Charlie.
I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.
But I couldn't go through with the singing again.
You don't know what it means to know that people....
That the whole audience doesn't want you.
All right.
You won't have to fight them anymore.
What are you doing?
Charlie, what time is it?
11:30 In New York?
I said what time is it in New York?
-Night?
The Bulldog's just gone to press.
Well, hurray for the Bulldog.
Gee, 11:30.
Shows are just getting up. People are going to nightclubs and restaurants.
Of course, we're different because we live in a palace.
You always said you wanted to live in a palace. A person could go crazy in this dump.
Nobody to talk to, nobody to have any fun with.
49,000 acres of nothing but scenery and statues.
I'm lonesome.
Until yesterday, we've had no less than 50 of your friends at any one time.
I think if you look in the west wing you'll probably find a dozen vacationists still in residence.
You make a joke out of everything. Charlie, I want to go to New York.
I'm tired of being a hostess.
I want to have fun. Please, Charlie.
Charlie, please.
What are you doing?
One thing I can never understand:
It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting statues.
You may be right.
I sometimes wonder but you get into the habit.
It's not a habit, I do it because I like it. I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow.
Invite everybody to spend the night at the Everglades.
Invite everybody.
Order everybody, you mean, and make them sleep in tents.
Who wants to sleep in tents when they've got their own room with a bath, where they know where everything is?
I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow.
"It can't be love
"For there is no true love
"l know I've played at the game
"Like a moth in a blue flame
"Lost in the end, just the same "All these years
"My heart's been floating around in a puddle of tears
"l wonder what it is"
Sure, you give me things, but that don't mean anything to you.
You're in a tent, darling, you're not at home.
I can hear you very well if you speak in a normal tone of voice.
What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving someone $100,000 for a statue you'll keep crated up and never look at?
It's just money.
It doesn't mean anything.
You never really gave me anything that you care about.
I want you to stop this. I'm not going to stop it.
You just tried to buy me into giving you something.
Whatever I do, I do because I love you.
You don't love me. You want me to love you.
Sure. "I'm Charles Foster Kane.
"But you gotta love me."
Don't tell me you're sorry.
Mrs. Kane would like to see you, sir.
Marie has been packing for her since morning.
Tell Arnold I'm ready, Marie. Tell him he can get the bags.
Yes, madame.
Have you gone completely crazy?
Don't you know that our guests, that everyone will know about this?
Packed your bag, sent for the car-- And left you?
Of course they'll hear.
I'm not saying goodbye, except to you. But I never imagined people wouldn't know.
Goodbye, Charlie.
Please don't go.
Please, Susan.
From now on, everything will be exactly the way you want it to be.
You can't do this to me.
I see.
It's you that this is being done to.
It's not me at all.
Not what it means to me.
In case you haven't heard, I lost all my money and it was plenty.
The last 10 years have been difficult for many.
They haven't been tough on me. I just lost all my money.
-You're going down to Xanadu?
-Monday, with boys from the office. Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed.
We run a picture magazine.
If you're smart, you'll get in touch with Raymond.
He's the butler. You'll learn a lot from him.
He knows where all the bodies are buried.
Don't you think I do?
What do you know, it's morning already.
Rosebud?
Well, I'll tell you, Mr. Thompson.
-He acted funny sometimes, you know?
-No, I didn't. Yes, he did crazy things sometimes.
I've been working for him 11 years now in charge of the whole place, so I ought to know.
-Rosebud. -Yes.
Like I tell you, the old man acted kind of funny sometimes...
-...but I knew how to handle him--
I see. And that's what you know about Rosebud?
I heard him say it that other time, too.
He just said:
"Rosebud." Then he dropped the glass ball and it broke on the floor.
He didn't say anything after that, and I knew he was dead.
He said all kinds of things that didn't mean anything.
Sentimental fellow, aren't you? -Yes and no.
-That isn't worth $1,000.
You can keep on asking questions if you want to.
We're leaving tonight when we're through taking pictures.
Allow yourself plenty of time. The train stops at the junction on signal, but they don't like to wait.
I can remember when they'd wait all day if Mr. Kane said so.
Better get going.
-Can we come down? -Yes, hurry up. We're leaving.
How much do you think this is all worth, Mr. Thompson?
Millions.
If anybody wants it.
Well, at least he brought all this stuff to America.
-What's that? -Another Venus. $25,000.
A lot of money to pay for a dame without a head.
The banks are out of luck? -They'll clear all right.
-He never threw anything away.
"Welcome home, Mr. Kane, from 467 employees of the New York Inquirer."
"One stove from the estate of Mary Kane, Little Salem, Colorado.
A regular crow, eh?
-We got a lot of those.
A Burmese temple and three Spanish ceilings down the hall.
Part of a Scotch castle that needs to be unwrapped.
Put all this stuff together:
The palaces and the paintings, and the toys and everything.
