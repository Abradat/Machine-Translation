Why, my dear, I'm surprised at you.
What a leave-taking that would be.
You wouldn't have me go tonight, would you?
Would you let me go tonight?
Would you?
- No, sir.
- Of course not.
Quite unworthy of our great love.
No, my dear, I'm not going now.
I'm going to spend the evening here with you just as you want.
Say, "Just as I want."
- "Just as I want."
- That's right, my little bird.
The last evening is always the sweetest, you know.
And what a farewell this one will be.
What a farewell.
I don't know whether I shall be able to tear myself away from you.
Perhaps I shall go only as far as the door... and the sight of your tears will bring me back.
- Does that please you, my dear?
- Yes, sir.
Why don't you show it, then?
Why don't you dance?
Why don't you sing?
Sing, my dear!
Sing, my little pigeon!
Get up and sing!
You hear?
Look, my darling, how tight your garter is.
You mustn't wear it so tight.
It will bruise your pretty, tender flesh.
Your tea, sir.
Thank you, Poole.
I shall be going out presently.
- Miss Muriel is returning to London today.
- Very good, sir.
- See this key, Poole?
- Yes, sir.
It's the key to the back door of the laboratory, sir.
I'll have no further use for it.
From now on, I'll use only the front door.
Yes, sir.
Deliver this to Miss Ivy Pearson, Diadem Court, Soho.
- Any message, sir?
- None. Deliver it and come away.
- Hyde'll kill you one day.
- I wish he would kill me.
I wish he would.
Why don't you run away?
Where to?
He'd find me wherever I was.
Then why don't you go to the police?
They'd fix this Hyde man.
No. I'm afraid.
There ain't nobody to help me.
Nobody.
Who cares what becomes of the likes of me?
Come in.
Miss Ivy Pearson?
- That's me.
- This is from my master, Dr. Jekyll, miss.
- Not Dr. Henry L. Jekyll?
- Quite so.
He said there is no answer.
Good day, miss.
I don't know Dr. Jekyll.
Fifty pounds!
Well, he knows you, dearie.
Strike me pink!
Fifty pounds from the celebrated Dr. Jekyll.
He's a grand gentleman, always helping them what needs help.
Now, dearie, he sends you fifty pounds... shows he takes an interest in you.
Why don't you go and thank the gentleman proper?
Then you could tell him all about this here Hyde business.
He'll tell that blighter what's what.
You'll see if he don't.
You made me suffer so.
Now you tell me nothing.
I tell you no man ever needed another or loved another... as I need and love you.
I don't know what to say... but if you'd been ill that would have been different.
I was ill, my darling.
Why didn't you let me know?
I should have come at once.
I wasn't ill in body. I was ill in soul.
The sufferings of the spirit are so difficult to communicate... even to those who love you.
