Get your hands off me.
Pin her down!
Stay there!
You need to stay put.
Call the Director.
Tell him I'll give him everything I've been collecting, all the evidence against him.
- You don't need to concern yourself with the Director anymore.
You're in my care now, Reddington.
You don't understand.
They're gonna come after me, after us.
Look, I know, but there has to be something you can do.
Who?
Please, listen.
You've done enough.
No. Come on.
Why?
You got yourself into something, right?
Tell me what.
Let me help you.
Um...
What do you know about underground boxing?
Human dog fighting.
People die. You don't want to bet on that.
No, no, no.
I didn't bet on it.
I did it.
I mean, I-I fought.
Let me guess.
You lost.
No.
I won. That's the problem.
These guys-- they wanted me to throw a fight, but...
People lost a lot of money-- the wrong kind of people.
He paid them back, but these people, they-- they found out about his family.
They're extorting him-- 20 grand a month.
They'll kill him if he doesn't pay.
That guy, the one you scared off, he's low-level.
But the guys he works for are, uh, Russians.
You know, they're organized.
Russians?
I hired a private detective to see if I could cut a deal.
They found pieces of him along the Allegheny.
It's never gonna end.
Yeah, it is, because I'm gonna fix it.
No, listen, please.
I owe you this.
I can't let you-- Hey, let him talk.
Okay.
What would you do, Matt?
To do what I do well, I need my enemies to fear me.
Every life that I take sends a message.
What happens next will be international news.
I'm gonna execute a terrorist and a crime lord.
Style points count.
Solomon!
One...
Solomon!
...must work slowly, with great attention to detail, peeling flesh from bone like a butcher filleting a salmon.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Lizzy, where'd he go-
- Solomon? He got away.
Dembe. Ahh. I've secured a safe site less than a mile away-- 5243 North Park.
Call me as soon as you arrive.
Dembe?
Dembe?
We're gonna get you well.
We're going with him.
What are you doing?
I'm going with Dembe.
You're not safe here.
Aram, tell me she's off the site.
I thought I could.
- I thought, uh--
- We gave you the name of the man who created the site two hours ago.
Have you found him?
Yes, but it is a two-key system. He is only one of the keys.
The other key is this Arioch Cain, the person who put her on the site, and I can't find him unless I can follow the money, and there is no money to follow until the bounty is put in escrow.
Mr. Reddington, I am so sorry, but the only way they're taking Agent Keen's name off the site is if she's dead.
Well, we're just gonna have to kill her.
Uh, I'm sorry. Bad connection.
Did you just say we'll have to kill her?
Aram, listen to me very carefully.
This is what I need you to do.
Today is your lucky day. You're going to cop a plea.
All you have to do is enter your passkey and confirm that Wendigo killed Agent Keen.
Date of death, cause of death, and unique identifier-- Psalm 1:1.
When you do, Arioch Cain will enter his passkey to release the bounty.
No one is releasing anything without independent verification that she's dead.
We have someone working on that. ♪ mm mm mm, if I break your heart ♪ Open up a bit.
There. Good. ♪ mm mm mm, if I break your heart ♪
Are you sure this is a good idea? - ♪ can you feel love anymore?
♪ - Yes. Get the photos to Sandquist at the Chronicle.
I want everyone to know what happened here today.

Dad!
They got her.

And we are just now getting reports that former FBI Agent Elizabeth Keen has been shot and killed.
No comment yet from the FBI... ♪ if I break your heart ♪
Agent Ressler knows what we're doing, right? I mean, he knows about Agent Keen?
I called, but he's still testifying before the commission.
He is not gonna like this.
The men you work for--

From now on, you deal with me.
They will come for you, huh?
I'm counting on it.
♪ don't wanna see you struggle when ♪ Yes, worse than I thought.
I'm gonna need the shop-vac and three tins of Buckner's saddle soap.
Okay, tell me what you see.
Uh, the website says "Kill confirmed."
Perfect.
Okay, Delgado's admin site should automatically release the funds into escrow.
When they do, Wendigo should get an e-mail with a link to a routing number.
Now, the actual funds won't be available for 32 hours, but the routing number can be back-traced to give us an address.
Hang on.
Here we go.
I got an e-mail. Read me the routing number.
Thank you, Aram.
That will be all.
What are you doing?
I'd prefer to know who put you on that site before the FBI.
I can't get a physical address from the routing number without Aram's help.
Borakove, wake and bake and grab a pen.
I have a routing number I need you to track.
Arioch Cain?
You?
You look like you've seen a ghost.
You're supposed to be dead.
I saw it on the news.
- Take me off the site.
- Site?
What site? What are you talking about?
Look at me and listen to what I'm saying to you, because I'm in no mood to repeat myself.
We know what you've done.
We know you have the power to stop it.
No, he doesn't.
I'm the one you're looking for.
I'm the one who wants you dead.
On the couch.
You need to take me off that site.
No!
What site?
! What the hell is going on?
What are you people doing here?
She ruined everything.
This isn't a game!
People are trying to kill me!
Blair, what are they talking about?
What you wanted.
How many times have you said that you wanted her dead, that you wanted the person who killed mom to die?
The Orea bombing.
Your mother died in the Orea bombing.
Look at her.
Her name was Sharon.
Did you know that before you blew her up?
Blair, honey, whatever they're telling you to do--
No!
Dad, no.
I am so sorry, but I had nothing to do--
You killed her!
No, she didn't.
It's understandable that you would think she did,
- but she didn't.
- You're wrong. Take it down, Blair, before more innocent people die.
My mom was innocent.
I lost my mom when I was a little girl.
I know how you feel.
You don't.
I still think about her every day-- what we might talk about... what her voice might sound like.
I promise you,
I had nothing to do with your mother's death.
I will do whatever it takes to find the people responsible.
But I can't do anything until you take me off that site.
_
Thank you.
Blair...
I'm gonna get the people that killed your mother.
You made the right call.
Not only is Keen safe, but the site's down, and we have leads on four assassins we didn't know existed.
I thought you'd be furious.
You know what I am?
I'm scared, because for a minute,
I thought Keen was gone.
I thought that, uh...
Agent Ressler, when you have a moment.
We got to do a better job.
We got to go out there, and we got to find her and bring her in, because every day she's out there is the day we could lose her.
Don't ever hug me like that again.
Mrs. Hitchin, I assume you're here to tell me that the Commission came to a sensible decision about how to handle the Director.
These red velvet cake pops are delicious.
The Commission's work is ongoing, but Laurel and I think it's prudent for us all to be on the same page.
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.
Yeah, it is, and here's why.
We're not gonna repeat the intelligence failures of 9/11.
The FBI and the CIA must communicate, which means you two must work together.
From now on, you share intel-- anything and everything relating to the whereabouts of Reddington and Keen.
I'm fine with that.
Agency's always been an open book on this topic.
I think you're making a big mistake here.
The President doesn't agree.
And if I'm not willing to cooperate?
Then you'll be replaced by someone who is.
Agent Ressler, in the interests of national security, this is the best course of action.
Hmm. Seems you've upgraded this place.
I'd love to have a tour.
Everyone has a way they want to be perceived-- a cover story, a lie.
They tell you what they want you to believe.
But I think actions speak louder than words, especially the ones we take out of loyalty or our sense of duty or love or out of hope for a second chance.
That's all I want for you, Liz-- a second chance.
I'll do anything to make sure that you get it.
I hope you're okay. If you get this, I'll be here.
- Hey, where have you been?
- Working on my tan.
How did it go? I tried calling you.
We had a very, uh, productive conversation.
Oh, my God.
Is that-- is that blood on your collar?
What have you done?
Hey, look, I told you I would fix it, so I did.
Open the trunk. - No, Gwen...
- Open the trunk!
You don't want me to do that.
Do you have any idea who these people are?
If you did something, if you--
They're gonna think it was me, okay?
They'll come for me.
No, they're not gonna come for you without going through me first.
Gw-Gwen!
Oh, my God.
Oh. It's fine.
Don't worry about it.
♪ ohh, feel like crying ♪ It's done.
Previously on "the blacklist"...
To help elizabeth keen?
Anything.
Find karakurt.
The cabal hired him to do what she's being framed for.
Figure out a way to infiltrate the crime ring
That may be protecting karakurt.
They will come for you, huh?
I'm counting on it.
Marvin gerard -- acts as shadow counsel
To some of the biggest players in the criminal underworld.
Yeah, we could make it work.
We only have one shot at this.
I'll be in touch.
I'm here because people in our organization
Have lost confidence in you.
The fbi and the cia must communicate,
Which means you two must work together.
I'm fine with that.
The brain is everything.
Memory, consciousness...
Personality.
Imagine if we could free the brain from the body.
What then?
Without that wretched carcass marching you toward death,
You might live forever.
You'd like to live forever, wouldn't you, dr. Kucera?
I know i would.
Despite the pain and isolation of being trapped in that skin, your paper on twin prime conjecture
Set the world of number theory on fire.
hats off to you, sir.
Hats off.
I'm in awe of your intellect
And the seminal contributions you've made
To the field of mathematics.
Well, that's why -- that's why i've chosen you to --
To join us on this wonderful voyage.
Soon, you'll be free of that broken shell.
You'll be able to walk and talk with ease.
You may even be able to sing and dance.
Does that appeal to you, dr. Kucera?
I should think it would.
You and i, along with the others,
Will free ourselves.
we shall slip the surly bonds of earth
And touch the face of god.
I see the captain's turned on the seat belt sign.
Well Make sure that your seat back and folding tray
Are in their full upright position.
We're in for a bumpy ride.
okay.
Drink.
It's japanese macha tea.
It has 17 times the antioxidants of wild blueberries
And seven more than dark chocolate.
You will be fine, elizabeth.
He will make sure of it.
I thought i was taking care of you.
How's the patient?
Stubborn.
Sweet.
Stubborn.
Lizzy, what do you know about andras halmi?
The french economist?
Belgian.
He's an econometrician.
He develops economic models
Using regression analysis and game theory.
One of the world's greatest minds.
And he's been abducted.
What does that mean to us?
Andras halmi is the director's most trusted adviser
And has information that is critical to our plan.
At first, i thought it might be a random abduction,
But that appears not to be the case
Because another elite econometrician
Went missing in paris 10 days ago.
"another"?
How many are there?
It's a small group -- too small to be a coincidence.
In the last six months,
Two acclaimed geneticists have gone missing,
Two prize-winning civil engineers --
Always a man and a woman.
Someone is building an ark, lizzy,
And populating it
With some of the most brilliant minds of our time.
But to clear your name, we need to find andras halmi.
And to find andras halmi, we have to find that ark.
We know about the abductions.
The bureau believes it's some kind of a brain drain.
Whoever's responsible is organized and resourceful.
Likely a foreign power.
Why force your country to learn
When you can just grab the world's experts
And advance decades overnight?
It's a novel theory, donald,
But, like all novels, it's fiction.
We're not dealing with a rogue nation-state here.
We're dealing with the next name on the blacklist.
We're not.
Not unless you give me a good reason why.
The director.
You've been ordered to work together,
To share intelligence in the pursuit of agent keen.
I imagine that's a rather awkward
And fraught relationship --
One you'd be anxious to terminate.
I'm listening.
Andras halmi, a confidant of the director's,
Is among the missing.
He has valuable information i need.
You want us to find him.
Yes. Without alerting the director, of course.
Yeah, well, good luck with that.
His team's tapping into our system.
Be that as it may,
He must not find out about this case.
So, getting settled in okay?
You can dispense with the pleasantries.
We're not your houseguests.
My team has been reviewing the activities
Of this task force for the past few weeks,
And it appears that you have not only been communicating
With reddington and keen,
But have been assisting them in some investigative capacity.
That's right.
That was him on the phone, giving us another case.
So you admit, then, to servicing reddington's agenda
Instead of hunting him down?
We talk to them because it keeps them close,
Increases our chances of making an arrest.
you do more than talk.
The djinn, the verdiant indictments --
Every case that reddington has given us
Has taken down someone important to the cabal.
That okay with you?
I don't have time for conspiracy theories, agent ressler,
And neither do you.
This next case -- full debriefing in 30 minutes.
You're telling me you had no other choice but to kill this man?
I did what i had to do in order to get to karakurt.
They'll be looking for you.
Yeah, i hope so.
That was your plan?
To kill a known associate of charlie volkens.
You know, i don't exactly remember you offering up a better plan.
Do you have any idea who you're dealing with?
Let me remind you.
Charlie volkens isn't just karakurt's brother-in-law.
He's a drug dealer, an extortionist,
Runs an underground fight club.
He's a sociopath surrounded by people who fear him.
The bureau can pin three murders on volkens
But can't get a conviction
Because nobody in the community is willing to talk.
Which is why you couldn't get him.
In fact, you couldn't even find him,
And now he is coming to find me.
He's coming to kill you.
And once he has you, once you're in his world,
That's exactly what he's gonna do.
I don't care.
He's hiding karakurt.
I won't be able to help.
I'm gonna find him.
I'm gonna drag karakurt back here if i have to.
They'll also come for asher sutton.
You gonna let him die, too?
If that's what it takes to exonerate liz.
Biophysicist goes missing in berlin.
Another is taken in rome.
A neurologist vanishes in johannesburg,
While another goes missing in san francisco.
Always a man And a woman.
Reddington identified six victims -- three pairs.
Using his theory,
We've been able to create 16 matches worldwide -- 32 victims.
Anthropology, computer science.
This may sound random, but it's not.
This is a list
Of the key graduate-degree programs at harvard.
He's collecting leaders in each field of study.
Once he chooses a discipline,
He completes the pair before moving on.
Two days after an anthropologist was taken in nepal,
Another one was taken in ankara.
Hang on. I think i may have a lead on his next victim.
This is dr. Richard kucera,
Chair of mathematics at a university in barcelona.
Dr. Kucera disappeared two days ago.
You expect his next victim to be a woman in the same discipline?
Exactly.
Thing is, there's only one female chair of mathematics
Who's at the same level as dr. Kucera,
And she is here in america.
Her name is anna neehoff.
Currently on sabbatical, living in arlington -- 6234 norwood drive.
Contact local p.D. Send all units.
Samara and i are headed there now.
This is it?
This is all you have?
What's reddington's agenda?
Welcome to our world.
There is something you're not telling me.
Who he's after, for instance.
I'd like a name.
He didn't give me a name.
Look, if you got a problem,
Why don't you take it up with reven wright?
We got a job to do.
Got her.
First floor, second window from the right.
Same play as the others?
Yep.
Grab her, bag her, take her to the cloud.
I wanted you to see this, dr. Kucera.
This is the procedure we'll be doing with you.
Freeing that beautiful mind.
Yeah.
We've located dr. Neehoff.
Good news.
We've found you a mate.
Like you, she's a mathematician.
And i think...
In the utopia i'm preparing for all of us,
You'll see why i chose her for you.
Bradley.
Relating to these abductions?
Everything in the system.
Do it.
I have a feeling
There's something they're not telling us.
Yes, sir.
No answer on her cellphone.
Where's your head at?
With the director in the war room,
If we find liz, he finds liz.
And if he finds liz...
He'll kill her.
We have protocols in place that'll guarantee keen's safety.
You think he'll follow the rules?
Laurel hitchin put him in here.
If he goes off book,
It blows back in her face and the president's.
No way she's gonna let that happen.
Youhave one new voicemail message.
Dr. Neehoff, my name is samara navabi.
I'm with the fbi.
We believe you may be in danger.
we're on our way to you right now.
Please lock all of your doors and do not let anyone in.
Back door and garage are clear.
Tommy. Radio nolan and tell him to watch the front.
Shut up!
Anna?
Anna?
Units in pursuit of a blue econoline
With three suspects heading west on lexington.
Down!
Stay back!
get out of the vehicle.
Put your weapon down.
Ressler, he took off toward the house.
You move, your next thought's gonna be about a bullet.
The men are working as fast as they can.
You built that awful grotto for that wedding in tuscany
In six days, complete with stalactites.
Well, that was different.
Yes, but infinitely more complicated,
And you ripped it out in a day and a half.
Yeah, and i didn't have an inspector up my ass eight hours a day.
Cedric, lives are at stake, the fate of nations.
Bribe someone, push someone around.
I don't care. Just get it done.
Where's this inspector?
I want to talk with this guy.
Dembe, the pelican case.
Marvin.
Tell me you've found andras halmi.
There's been a small wrinkle.
Halmi is all that matters.
The director is working with the task force.
Need i remind you that without halmi,
A crucial element of our plan vanishes
Faster than a fart in a fan factory?
You wanted to see me?
Ah. You must be --
Busy keeping track of all your code violations.
Portofino is lovely this time of year.
Life's too short to spend haggling
Over flex conduits and electrical chases.
My son drowned in portofino.
Well, who could've predicted that?
Forget the inspector.
What about halmi?
Leave halmi to me.
You find out whatever you can about that inspector.
Hey, gwen.
Asher around?
We told you not to come back here, okay?
Where is he?
Asher!
Hey.
What are you doing here?
Pack your bags.
Do you have a safe?
Open it.
We called the police.
We want nothing to do with you.
Get your passports and whatever cash you have in the house.
Do it right now.
The police --
The police aren't gonna be here in time, gwen.
The others.
They're coming.
For you. Okay?
We didn't kill anyone.
We did what they asked.
Do you have a safe?
We'll tell them what happened.
We'll just -- we'll tell them the truth.
The truth is, they sent someone to get a debt, and he's dead.
Somebody has to pay.
So, t-they're gonna kill us?
Is that what you're saying?
I'm trying to help you, all right?
If you just do exactly what i say --
You did this to us!
You came into our lives.
Y-you targeted us.
Yeah.
Why?
Listen to me right now.
These men -- they are going to be armed,
They are going to be very, very dangerous,
And they are going to try to hurt you.
who are you?
Listen to me -- find a place to hide
And do not come out, no matter what you hear.
Do you understand?
I want my lawyer.
He's more afraid of whoever he's working for
Than he'll ever be of us.
He's not talking.
He'll talk to me.
The inspector -- what'd you find?
There's not much.
Ex loves him, taxes paid, church on sunday.
But he does have one weakness --
Lisa thomopoulos.
Aspirations of becoming a pastry chef.
Flunked out of cordon bleu.
Seems she can't tell a baklava from a balaclava.
I forgot the egg wash.
Okay. I-i-i just -- i just need to clear my head.
I-i'll have a cigarette.
10 minutes.
Can i just take 10 minutes?
You must be lisa.
Max said your eyes were radiant,
But my god.
Mesmerizing.
It's a very small space.
We want to brighten.
I love mauve, but a soft, creamy yellow
Will just open up the entire room.
We also need to land on cabinet options and millwork today.
I'm already arguing with my supplier.
Tell me if i'm going too fast.
I'm sorry.
I have no idea what any of this means.
Oh, my goodness.
Max didn't tell you.
Tell me what?
About your restaurant.
I... Don't have a restaurant.
I... Think we need to take a drive.
Your birth name is michael karpos.
I understand you've been employed
By some of our subcontractors.
Well, on behalf of our nation, thank you for your service.
I also see that you have an ex-wife
And a daughter who attends st. Bartholomew's academy
In scotch plains, new jersey.
Hmm. Pretty.
Are you acquainted with the bible, mr. Karpos?
I am.
At one point, i actually considered the priesthood.
Can you imagine?
There's a passage -- exodus 20:5-6.
"for i, the lord thy god, am a jealous god,
Visiting the iniquities of the fathers
Upon the children."
We wouldn't want that.
Would we, mr. Karpos?
The man you're looking for is sir crispin crandall.
The reclusive billionaire?
He's behind the abductions?
He takes them to a complex
Near the boston-manchester regional airport,
And what he does there, god only knows.
Come now, richard.
Eat. Drink.
It's not as if you have to worry about putting on weight.
Soon, we'll be relieving you of that crippled body...
To prepare you for a brave new world.
Sir? Hmm?
It's about miss neehoff.
It appears we have a situation.
Mm. Dear, dear, dear.
Keep eating, richard.
I shall return.
Matias, i don't appreciate being summoned.
Talk to me about andras halmi.
You thought the task force was holding something back.
They were.
Who is he?
How do you know what i was or was not thinking?
I know everything, peter.
Almost always before you.
Your analyst discovered
That they deleted halmi's name so you wouldn't find it.
Why?
Andras halmi is a trusted adviser.
Then why haven't i heard of him?
He's critical to this organization,
And he must be found.
I think you're lying.
Fine, then.
Don't help.
But if you don't
And our friends in bonn learn of your... Insubordination,
I don't think they're gonna be very pleased.
Okay.
Tell me what you know.
Plumbing leak, missing handrails.
Handrails?
Handrails? !
Exposed wiring, unlicensed subcontractor.
You're shut down.
Okay, fine. You shut us down.
I will sue you for losses, you beer-swilling frostback!
Lisa?
I know, i know.
I ruined the whole damn thing.
But there were too many decisions to make without her.
After all, it is her restaurant.
I can't believe this.
Max has been working night and day
To get this place fixed up.
All those classes, the hours you spent
Perfecting your tarts, your... Crumpets.
If he's told me once, he's told me a thousand times
You should be feeding all of montreal
In your own restaurant.
I don't know what to say.
Neither do i.
We could do puff pastries.
Oh, and a little sunday brunch.
And those little tea cakes that you love!
I need one day
Working 'round the clock with no interruptions.
After that, the place is yours.
Who are you?
The man who's gonna help you make her dreams come true.
Clever.
But none of it's gonna matter unless we get andras halmi.
Crispin crandall.
Wait.
You don't have authority to go --
That's a no-knock warrant.
Get on the phone.
Call your boss.
Tell him the fbi needs to talk with crispin crandall.
What the hell is this place?
We're not gonna wait to find out.
I want to talk to charlie volkens.
You got any idea where you are, sport?
You know what we do here?
Asher sutton.
He has nothing to do with this.
Oh, yeah, he does.
Tonight he does.
You two got ringside seats.
He's innocent.
You don't have to hurt him.
Oh, i ain't got to hurt anybody.
That, i leave to you.
You boys are top of the card tonight.
No queensbury rules.
Unlimited rounds.
Winner takes... Everything.
.
Crandall cryonics is a legitimate firm
In cryogenic preservation.
It's more hope than science,
But true believers think it's possible
To freeze the human body, suspend death and disease
So that patients might be reanimated and cured
When new technology is developed in the future.
According to the company's records,
None of the missing scientists are here.
The dewars contain patients with legally binding contracts.
Well, if they're not here, then where are they?
If the employees know, they're not saying,
And we can't question crandall.
Why?
Because he's a billionaire?
Because he lives on a plane, which he refuels in the air.
Wait -- what?
He doesn't land?
According to the faa,
He's landed 30 times in the past three years.
Each time coincided with the date of an abduction.
He was scheduled to land today
But scrubbed it less than an hour
After we prevented anna neehoff from being taken.
He was coming for her -- like the others.
This plane is an ark.
Or a jail.
It can't be easy keeping 36 people against their will.
It is if they're frozen.
Um, no.
It's an a380.
Definitely big enough to contain a mobile lab
And store multiple corpses.
Doctor.
It appears we have an issue with our fuel tanker.
A small change in schedule.
But fear not.
Once everything is under control,
We'll move ahead with your procedure posthaste.
Don't go anywhere.
We think we know what happened to the people who were abducted.
You found halmi?
The victims were cryogenically frozen
By some nutjob billionaire named crispin crandall.
Frozen?
Yeah.
Where is he keeping them?
In his jet --
Some flying icebox that never touches down.
He has a refueling tanker.
Not anymore.
We grounded it.
Excellent.
That's all i need.
Ring edward.
Tell him we need the jet.
We're gonna pay a little visit to sir crispin crandall.
Crispin crandall?
I thought he was dead.
No, he's very much alive, and it seems he's responsible
For our international brain drain.
He has halmi.
But he also has a big problem i may be able to alleviate --
The fbi.
You gave them this case.
And now i'm taking it away.
Crandall is flying into a trap.
He needs somewhere to land his spruce goose.
Okay, people.
We have 67 minutes before that plane drops out of the sky.
I need a location -- now.
Sir?
Take a look at this.
We found him.
Nsa satellite picked up an a380 descending
On course for a regional airstrip outside halifax.
The plane's waiting.
I'll notify rcmp on the way.
Target is headed for pittsburgh.
And the fbi?
Headed for halifax, based on false satellite intel,
When, in fact, crandall's jet should be touching down
At a former military runway near pittsburgh
In about 30 minutes.
Connellsville.
I know it.
I'm guessing that reddington redirected crandall there,
Since he wants halmi --
Probably cut a deal with him to get him,
Which means that reddington will be there,
As will keen.
This is fun.
Terminate them both.
Secure halmi's body.
His body?
If halmi's dead, why does reddington still want him?
Just take care of reddington and keen,
And we will be done...
With loose ends.
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen.
Our final bout today
Is a no-holds-barred grudge match
Between two rank amateurs.
There will be no rules.
Sucker-punching, kicking, biting, and gouging
Is not only allowed...
But encouraged.
The winner will be...
The last man...
Breathing.
Fight!
Come on, man.
Put your hands up.
Come on, man.
If you don't fight, they're gonna kill us both.
I didn't come here to fight!
I came here for the russian.
He doesn't want to fight.
What should we do about that, gentlemen?
Hmm?
Don't make me do this.
I'm sorry.
The plane's not going to halifax?
Pl eusnjweoy tfonty-onur m th noer intfiest innancg. Apparently not.
But we're going to halifax.
Nsa intel indicated that's where the plane was heading.
Uh... It's not.
It's landing near pittsburgh.
The opposite direction.
How is this possible?
The director set us up.
Aram, are you sure about this?
I set up an air-traffic-control alert
For crandall's transponder,
Figuring when he moved through controlled airspace,
He'd have to turn it back on.
The alert says pittsburgh.
Where the director will have a team waiting for them.
And reddington.
When i talked to him --
I think he knows where the plane is headed.
If he does, he and liz are walking into a trap.
I'll tell the pilot to change our heading to pittsburgh.
Refueling is done.
We can be airborne as soon as you complete
Your business with mr. Reddington.
He's here?
Ah, there he is.
Sir crispin.
I'm raymond reddington.
What are you doing here?
I wired payment for the fuel.
And i voided it.
Truth be told, i've decided on a different form of payment --
Andras halmi.
I'm not giving you halmi.
Of course you are.
At least, the part of him i'm interested in.
But first, please indulge my curiosity.
An ice castle in the air,
The best and the brightest frozen solid.
I'm intrigued.
You know what these are?
They're horseshoe crabs.
Mm. Decades ago, it was discovered
That their plasma contained limulus amebocyte lysate,
Which can be used to detect bacterial endotoxins.
I found a way to synthesize it.
That's how you made your fortune.
Mm. But more important,
They were the inspiration for my vision.
They have survived four mass extinctions.
We are now on the cusp of the final mass extinction,
Caused by a species of clever but greedy primates
Known as homo sapien.
Everyone dies, mr. Crandall.
Death is a process.
No one is really dead until the information
Contained in the brain is lost.
Cryonic preservation prevents that loss.
Are you a gambling man, crispin?
no.
I abhor casinos.
oh, yes. Well, i would agree with you there.
But perhaps you're familiar with the old saw
"you can't beat the house"?
No matter how many poor souls you turn into popsicles,
The fix is in.
The world in which you awaken will be one
Incapable of sustaining human life.
And why?
Because at the critical tipping point,
One tragically quixotic megalomaniac
Cannibalized humanity of the very minds
That might have been its salvation.
You see, if you were a betting man,
You would understand
That now trumps later every time.
The future is a sucker's bet --
A maybe, a contingency, a "what if?"
The only thing that is real is the present,
And you've plundered it --
Robbed it of the very geniuses
That might have averted the dystopia you so fear.
Indeed, perhaps even the very one
Who might have devised a means
To revive your sad, tired, frozen ass.
Congratulations, crispin.
You've doubled down on extinction.
Life on earth is going to end.
Soon.
Cryonics is our only hope.
It won't work.
I'm betting it will.
Ah. So you are a gambling man.
Let's place that bet, shall we?
What was that?
I thought i heard --
What happened?
Is he dead?
Dead?
Pishposh.
What's death?
It's just a process, right?
Notify the lab.
Tell them to gather the team
And prepare for a full-body cut-down.
Come here.
Open it.
Andras halmi -- dewar ut-0027.
Someone's here.
You have halmi?
More or less.
The thumbs appear to be missing.
His thumbs?
Peter, is this a problem?
Ressler.
Sir crispin crandall.
Banque canadienne du nord.
I'm with the united states department of justice.
Your courts have, uh, issued a warrant
Authorizing us to seize the safety-deposit box
Of a mr. Andras halmi.
It is critical that no third party interfere
And that the safety-deposit box be kept absolutely secure --
By any means.
Close it.
The director gave his attack dogs the real address
So they could get halmi and kill reddington and keen.
Do you still think our protocols will keep them safe?
They survived.
This time -- but as long as he's here,
As long as we're sharing information --
I said he wouldn't go off book.
I was wrong.
But thanks to these feeds that we got off of crandall's jet,
I can prove it now, and when i do,
Laurel hitchin will have no choice but to boot him out.
Today was a win, navabi.
How do you figure?
Reddington said halmi had information he needed.
My guess is he used his thumbs to get it --
To get past some kind of a biometric lock or a safe.
What kind of information?
I don't know.
But the director didn't want him to get it, and he did.
Son of a bitch can't be happy about that.
Hello, peter.
I hope i'm not interrupting cocktails with lynda.
Congratulations on getting to halmi before i did.
Yes, it certainly is celebratory drinks here,
So i'll be brief.
I think it's about time to exonerate elizabeth keen.
That is not going to happen.
Oh, but it is.
The only question is whether you'll live to see the day.
If i continue to dismantle the cabal,
They'll put a bullet in your head
Just to mitigate their losses.
Everything is working according to plan, peter.
You overestimate your influence, raymond.
Your plan is of no concern to us.
Peter.
You've been skimming from the company till,
Stealing millions in anticipation of running away.
When you were linked to the cabal,
You reached out to halmi --
Put your golden parachute
In a secret account only he could access.
Except now i've got it.
You have no money to escape the inevitable.
Your colleagues will abandon you.
Maybe not today or tomorrow, but soon enough,
Because i'm not going to stop until they do.
Unless i exonerate keen.
It's one small chance to save your life.
Such a generous offer.
I'll have to decline.
I'm going to bring this whole damn thing
Down on you, peter.
And when i do,
Your own people will beg me to kill you
To stop the bleeding.
Takes a hard heart to kill a man with a knife.
So... You wanted to see me?
Not you.
Him.
Who the hell are you?
I'm the guy who's taking you back to d.C.
To admit that you framed my wife for murder.
Here's how it's gonna play out.
I'll take tiny tim out first because he's the biggest threat.
Then russian guyavitch goes for his gun, right?
But i'm betting that he shoots one of you instead of me.
And volkens is already pissing his pants,
So i don't think he's gonna be a problem.
And that would leave...
Me and you.
Karakurt.
Don't kill me.
No.
Should be nine more workers inside, just rotated on shift.
Security? Two in the lobby, one in the lab.
Let's get to work.
Forget it.
Liz needs all the help she can get.
Since when are you interested in helping her?
All you've ever done is betray her.
Says the guy who's hunting her down.
You really think Liz is a Russian agent? A terrorist?
If you know where she is...
I don't. That's why I'm here.
Look, i know you don't trust me.
If it's any consolation, i don't trust you either.
Like I said. Forget it.
Don't you wanna know the truth?
Don't you wanna know what happened?
Easy.
Your ex is a wanted killer.
You wanna help her, let me do my job.
I know you care about Liz.
You can act like you don't, but I know you do.
Let me help. I can go places.
I can do things. Break the law?
Work around it.
Next time, i break that arm.
We were out.
You said the ship we were on was headed to Spain.
Change of plans.
Because after far too much time playing defense, today is the day we switch to offense.
Take a look around, we're hardly in prime position to be fighting anyone right now.
The director needed permission to have me killed, and he only got it by convincing others that I didn't have the fulcrum.
That was a costly mistake.
And now members of the cabal will be exposed as a result of investigations.
His own people are questioning his leadership.
We need to capitalize on that by wreaking such havoc on the cabal that they will choose to exonerate you, and sacrifice the director.
How is that ever gonna happen?
Our journey begins in the home of the double bacon corn dog.
Welcome to Iowa.
What do you know about verdiant industries, lizzy?
Nothing. They're the world's largest agribusiness.
They sell seeds.
More to the point, genetically engineered seeds.
In fact, they're the single largest manufacturer of genetically engineered seeds on earth.
And not just any seeds.
Corn, soy, the crops at the very foundation of our food economy.
I've read about this.
Modifying the DNA of the seed itself.
Teaching it to create a protein that kills common pests that would eat it.
Yes. And those seeds are very expensive.
Most small farmers can't afford them.
Many of them have been driven out of business.
And when people feel their homes and livelihoods threatened, violence is never far behind.
A few days ago, a verdiant facility was attacked by a group of small farmers who call themselves los segadores.
Men determined to kill verdiant before it kills them.
Damaging one building will hardly kill verdiant.
They did more than damage a building, lizzy.
They stole data, a cache of proprietary files detailing how verdiant modifies its corn genome.
That's a trade secret worth billions of dollars.
You and I are going to take those files from the men who stole them.
Assuming we could do that, why would we?
Verdiant launders money for the cabal, hundreds of millions of dollars a year.
If we get those files, we have leverage over verdiant.
We have leverage over verdiant, we have leverage over the cabal.
I know how Mr. reddington and agent keen got out of the diner where the standoff happened.
The tunnels, the ones they used to escape from the diner, they were built to sneak in contraband from the port of Baltimore.
Coordinate with the mpa.
I want a full accounting of all ships... Already did.
One particular freighter caught our attention.
The dmc pena set sail 48 minutes after the siege at the diner ended, en route to the Spanish port of valencia.
But 70 miles into their journey, they turned back to the us citing engine trouble.
Where's the freighter now?
They're docked at Norfolk late last night.
According to the cargo manifest, only one thing came off the ship.
Container number 358202 was off-loaded and placed on a westbound flatbed at 12:23 A.M.
Stowed away in a corrugated sardine can.
The glamorous life of an international fugitive...
I want to know where that truck's headed.
What is it?
Dembe.
This is the rendezvous point.
Something's wrong.
We're going to need transportation.
This'll do.
I'm not talking to you.
Dembe's missing.
They were here. The FBI.
When?
When?
What does it matter, when?
They were here.
And when I refused to answer their questions, they took me in...
Don't try my Patience, Glen. I'm sorry, red.
I'm hypoglycaemic.
My blood sugar crashed and I just lost it.
Glen... I must have spent six hours in the box.
I nearly had a stroke... What did you tell them?
I didn't have my crackers with me, i couldn't get a juice box.
I rolled, red! I'm sorry.
I told them everything.
Everything?
I'm yanking your crank.
What do you think I am, a snitch?
I'm clean as a whistle, which is more than I can say for your shorts.
I could hear you dropping a steamer through the phone.
We got wheels.
Safety!
Okay.
Dembe.
What's the 911?
Oh! You're a fool.
You think because you would risk your life to save reddington...
That he's gonna do the same?
He won't. Reddington won't come for you.
You are protecting a man that has left you for dead.
We have a colleague of yours.
He is being prepared.
Unless you tell me where i can find reddington, he will suffer.
Nothing?
So be it.
What you hear next is a consequence of your misplaced loyalty.
Please, no!
Gentlemen.
A moment of your time.
Eduardo.
I wouldn't.
You are members of los segadores, am I right?
A simple nod is acceptable.
Excellent.
I was hoping to have a word with your leader. That's me.
I don't believe so.
I was told to speak with a man named Eli matchett.
What are you, cops?
Goons working for verdiant?
Either way, I'm not telling you...
The next one goes in your leg.
Eli matchett.
- He's gone.
- Gone where?
I don't know.
I don't.
Look, verdiant has a warehouse up in silver Ridge, doing some top-secret research.
We were working on how to take it out when Eli, he just snapped.
Started saying how we were a joke, how none of us had the balls to make a real impact.
So, he walked.
Next we hear, nine people are dead.
You think matchett is responsible.
We got a guy on the inside at verdiant. Gabriel costa.
If Eli did this, he had costa's help.
We're going to need Mr. costa's address, and maybe some directions.
My associate prefers to steal cars made before the advent of GPS.
You were able to crack the server files?
All five billion nucleotide pairs.
Verdiant's patented prize pig.
I'm uploading the file to a couple dozen hosting sites.
Look, I know we agreed to open source this.
But this is verdiant's most guarded trade secret. It's worth a fortune.
So, what? You wanna sell to the highest bidder?
I wanna get back what that seed cost me.
My farm. My family. Yeah.
We sell and get back our losses, but no one else's.
This doesn't belong to verdiant, and it doesn't belong to us.
We release it to everyone.
Sorry, friends, but I got something else in mind.
Sure is one hell of a sardine can.
The man does have style.
Aram. I found something on the ap.
A bombing in Fairfield, at a facility owned by verdiant industries.
Reddington comes to town a few days after a major attack?
That's not a coincidence.
I thought the same thing.
So, I cross-referenced every senior-level employee with Mr. reddington's file and I came up with one name.
Verdiant's cto, Susan Hanover.
Why do I know that name? Because it was listed in the fulcrum.
Twenty-five years ago, Hanover was a low-level staffer on the hill.
A bombing with a direct link to the cabal.
That's why reddington's in town.
How many employees were lost?
Nine are confirmed dead, the other six are officially listed as unaccounted for.
They say some of the bodies are unidentifiable.
You have been hit before? The company, yeah, but not this facility. And never like this.
There's a group, calls itself los segadores.
Up to now, it's only been property damage.
So, why the escalation?
Because certain secure terminals can only access the company mainframe during business hours.
Whoever did this, accessed our proprietary files.
They downloaded information detailing how we modify our genomes.
That's a trade secret worth billions of dollars.
This was a robbery.
If that data is released publicly, it's only a matter of time before our product is being mass-produced on the black market.
The price of our product will fall permanently.
Our stock won't recover. Sir?
Sorry to interrupt, but I just received a call from the medical examiner.
What is it?
They ran preliminary DNA tests on the remains recovered inside and everyone was accounted for except for one employee, a Gabriel costa.
That's not possible.
His badge was used to swipe in that morning.
He was here. Unless he walked out with the attackers.
Maybe Gabriel costa's our inside man.
How long will you need?
Delivery system's done.
Now it's just two more hours for the completion of the replication period, and you'll have your virus.
Costa isn't here.
Then we look for anything that may reveal his whereabouts.
I don't know what happened.
I used to consider myself lucky.
I had a husband I loved, the job I always wanted.
I was the kind of person good things happened to.
Have you ever heard of mugs kalinowski?
Lovely guy.
Ugliest man i ever laid eyes on.
That's why everyone called him "mugs".
Except his dear mother.
She was an art professor at bard.
Lovingly referred to him as "Picasso".
That's kind of sweet, actually.
Well, it was an apt nickname.
His face was all over the place.
But perhaps as a result of that nickname, mugs grew up with a great appreciation for art.
He fenced some of the most extravagant pieces in the world.
He only had one rule, out of respect for dear mum.
He'd never lift a Picasso, felt it was bad luck.
Then one day, he got a tip from a source about a piece sitting in a huge loft in soho.
So, one evening, mugs shimmied up the drain pipe, broke in.
And lo and behold, there hung on the wall, les femmes d'alger.
A spectacular Picasso.
One of a series of 15 and astronomically valuable.
Did he take it?
And mugs was convinced that was the single, biggest stroke of bad luck he'd ever suffered.
Well, what he didn't know was, the source who had given him the tip was working with the feds.
The painting had a tracking device in it.
Sometimes bad luck is the best luck you'll ever have.
Whatever happened to mugs? Did he land on his feet?
Unfortunately, no.
Mugs had borrowed $500,000 from a loan shark against the value of the painting.
When he didn't steal it, he couldn't pay it back.
A few weeks later, the loan shark shot him dead.
There's something going on with that vent.
Time to go.
How did they find us? They didn't.
And they won't.
We need a drill.
Forget about the box. We need to leave.
They're one step behind us.
This is the life, lizzy.
Someone's always one step behind.
I'm sending you a photo, i want it sent wide. It's not aram.
Keen?
Why are you doing this?
It's my job.
You know me.
You know I've been framed.
If you're innocent, come in. Let me help you.
We know about the verdiant attack.
That's why you're here, isn't it?
I'm just trying to get my life back.
Verdiant's connected to the cabal.
Reddington thinks that if we can get enough leverage...
Reddington's not capable of telling the truth.
You know that.
If you're interested in the truth, back off.
Let me do what I have to do to clear my name. No.
You were at costa's apartment.
I'm getting close, aren't I, keen? Keen?
You were right, reddington and Liz were here.
We just missed them. Was there a surveillance camera?
No, but I pulled this off a responding officer's dash-cam, he was dispatched to meet us at the scene.
It looks like he blew right past them.
Run that plate.
Find out who that vehicle belongs to.
And put out an alert for the car.
Looks like costa was copying verdiant documents and feeding them to matchett and his crew.
He kept this ledger to keep track of the documents he stole.
He's got internal memos here tracking some development project called "Genesis".
He was sending them to a feed store in Wilson park?
Wait.
Look, we can't just go charging in there.
We had a hard enough time handling the cabal when the FBI was backing us, let alone hunting us down.
Don't be anxious.
We're still a step ahead.
I'm not anxious.
I'm scared.
Where are we?
Four hundred tiny viral vectors, ready to be released into the wild.
Imagine.
You can hold in one hand everything you need to bring humanity to its knees.
Table for one?
Or are you waiting on the rest of your party?
No, just me.
This order's to go.
Is the chicken gorgonzola gluten-free?
I believe so. You believe, or you know for sure?
Because although that may just be a small lexical distinction for you, for me, it'll determine whether I spend my entire evening on the can with two rolls of triple-ply.
Why don't I ask the chef.
Rover keypad.
Four digit pin.
Could be thousands of combinations.
Only if you don't know the four digits.
Now there's only 24 combinations.
Gabriel costa.
Agent navabi.
Copy that, Wilson park.
Have your officers secure the vehicle and stand down until we get there.
Patrol found the car. 355 mission.
What is this place?
This is it.
This is the genome data they stole from verdiant.
Let's get what we need and go.
That's the car.
Is that ressler and samar?
We're fine.
Keep working.
They're in the building.
- How much more time? - I don't know.
These files are massive.
We should go.
I saw a storm door on the side of the building, we...
Not yet.
The desk.
We're not going to make it.
Reddington!
Clear.
Ressler!
Think if you stare long enough, it might ring?
What's her name?
Elizabeth.
She's gone. Well, I was hoping that...
You know, when we met, she was seeing this other guy. He worked.
I didn't.
But we started seeing each other, anyway.
Anyway, we had this signal, a way of communicating, so he wouldn't know.
She'd call that phone at exactly 7:00 P.M.
And I'd pick up and we'd meet.
How'd that work out?
Not so great.
Hey. Uh, sorry.
Would you do me a quick favor?
Uh, just, if that phone rings, if she calls, would you give her my number?
I just spoke to the owner of the building.
He said he leased the space to a man named Eli matchett two months ago.
Did you get a background?
I did.
Matchett had a farm that adjoined one of verdiant's properties near abingdon.
Apparently, some of their seed blew onto his farm.
They claimed he illegally infringed on their patent and they sued him.
The defense cost matchett a fortune.
He must have lost everything.
Aram, did you get those files?
You've stumbled on a state-of-the-art virology shop.
Matchett didn't steal verdiant's genome blueprint so he could release it publicly.
He needed it to identify its weaknesses and design a virus tailor-made to destroy it.
He wants to sabotage their gmo crop?
90% of all corn grown in America is genetically modified.
Verdiant is the largest producer of it.
In fact, this one strain is planted all over the world.
If this virus gets out, it will spread fast.
How fast?
It would cross state lines in weeks, maybe even days.
Within months, it would migrate overseas.
If matchett unleashes this virus, we could have a global food crisis on our hands.
We've got about 90%, but I'm not sure it's readable.
We'd probably need help accessing the data without a complete download.
How the hell did ressler...
I called him. While you were in the store.
Why would you do that?
I told him to back off because I thought if he was interested in the truth...
Ressler's a law-enforcement robot. The FBI winds him up.
That's not true.
He's a person.
He's a good person. Look at me.
You need to let that go, lizzy.
I have survived for a very long time now.
And I assure you, i didn't do it by relying on the goodness in people.
We should go.
I'll check the parking lot, find us a new ride.
Meet me out front in a minute.
Yes, sir.
That was Gordon Pierce at verdiant.
You know that lawsuit against Eli matchett?
Yeah, what about it?
Matchett didn't just lose his farm because of it.
After the bank foreclosed, verdiant purchased his property in a short sale.
In fact, they bought out several other places in that area and turned them into one large industrial farm.
Verdiant's growing gmo corn on the very land that matchett grew up on.
You think that's where he plans to unleash the virus?
I think we just found ourselves ground zero.
Must be my lucky day.
Drop your gun!
Can't do that.
Raymond reddington.
You got any idea how many people want to see you dead?
Some idea, yes.
And you.
You're the girl on the news.
The Russian.
You seem like an intuitive guy.
At least intuitive enough to know when you're in over your head.
So, whichever low-life you're working for, he's gonna have to wait to get his revenge.
Set it down.
What's your emergency? What's your location?
We have to leave.
We can't.
We're in the middle of nowhere.
He'll be dead by the time the ambulance gets here.
I'm not leaving him.
Pockets.
We need help here!
Single shot to the chest!
He's breathing, but barely any pulse!
About 15 minutes ago!
Hey.
Hey!
Yes, but send two more units to ash and 3rd.
No visual on matchett yet.
But state police have locked up all roads leading into the verdiant property.
Reddington was on a ship bound for freedom, and he turns it around to come back here.
For verdiant.
Does he really think that taking these guys out is gonna get him closer to clearing keen's name?
Do you think he has a family?
Lizzy.
He's gonna die. Don't.
You saw that hospital?
They wouldn't have a thoracic surgeon on call, they'd have to medevac him to a different county.
You're right.
Thoracic surgeons would be very rare in Fairfield, Iowa.
What does that tell you?
Focus.
Who else would be rare in Fairfield?
A virologist who specializes in gmos.
So, where did Eli matchett find one?
The documents we got from costa, the ones he stole from verdiant, they were talking about a special development project, Genesis.
And Eduardo, this morning at the segadores farm?
He said verdiant was working on some top secret RD at a warehouse in silver Ridge.
What are you thinking?
That agent ressler may be of some use after all.
Possible suspect sighting, stand by.
Suspect sighted!
Headed north!
Head him off!
You boys about finished?
He's all yours.
- Ressler.
- I just received a cache of internal research documents from verdiant.
Definitely not the kind of stuff they'd want out there.
You got them how? Where did they come from?
That's the crazy part.
They came in on the fax hard-line.
I think she wants us to search a verdiant warehouse in silver Ridge.
Are you sitting down?
Because you're not gonna believe this.
I don't understand. What's the delay?
Well, what exactly do you know?
That's unacceptable.
Get me an update.
My god. You're Raymond reddington.
And you're Susan Hanover.
Chief technology officer at verdiant industries.
And corporate shill for the cabal. Come on.
Why don't we let the boy play?
I have some bad news, Susan.
The virus you helped Eli matchett create has been contained.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I think you do.
See, I thought Eli matchett was verdiant's greatest enemy.
I assumed he left los segadores because he wanted to be even more radical.
But that's not true, is it, Susan?
The truth is, he was co-opted by your company.
You paid him to attack that facility.
You wanted him to steal that data.
That's outrageous.
Well, we certainly agree on that.
You provided him with everything he needed, including the scientist who synthesized the virus.
Okay.
That's enough.
Sit down, Susan.
Let's not make a scene in front of the boy.
This virus you're talking about, why would we do that?
Why destroy our own product?
Perhaps you were willing to create this disease because you already possess the cure.
It's ingenious.
Hire a mad man to unleash a catastrophic threat, and then wait just long enough for the world to panic.
Why would we do that?
For the money, Susan.
So, you and your company could come rushing in with a new product at the perfect time.
A seed immune to the devastating scourge, and available, of course, at a much higher price.
You can't prove that. Oh, but I can.
I know about the Genesis project.
By now, so do the FBI.
At the risk of sounding immodest, I'm on their most wanted list.
Number one with a bullet.
They came here looking for me.
Unfortunately for you, what they found were dozens of internal verdiant documents, which will lead them to your warehouse in silver Ridge.
And I don't need to tell you what they'll find inside.
A stockpile of new seed, waiting to be sold to a desperate world on the verge of calamity.
You would have made a fortune and looked like heroes in the process.
I knew matchett was a mistake. Never met the man.
Wouldn't judge him too harshly, though.
He seized his chance to terrify the world, shine one glorious spotlight on the dangers of planting the same seed in fields all over the globe.
Progress.
It's a bitch.
What do you want?
I came here to ask you to deliver a message to your friend, the director.
This is only the beginning, and I won't stop until his own people realize that their only way forward is to exonerate Elizabeth keen and to leave the director to me.
Please, tell him I'm coming.
The verdiant arrest warrants are coming through.
They're being executed now.
There's something else. We just got word.
Liz shot an undercover cop earlier today.
What? What happened?
I'm not sure.
The details are still coming in.
But it does look like the guy's gonna make it.
I shot a cop.
Yes, you did.
And killed the Attorney General of the United States.
And when you did that, you crossed a threshold.
Leaving your world, entering mine.
Bad things are going to find you now, lizzy.
This life has a mind and a momentum of its own.
That's a reality you need to accept.
Bad things happen to good people. Am I a good person?
I'm not so sure any more.
Reddington obviously thinks that he can take the fight to the cabal.
But look what happened. This time, keen shot a cop.
And next time, she's gonna be the one getting hurt.
You know, I've watched you run the task force all this time and I don't think i ever appreciated how damn hard it was.
I'll deny it if you ever repeat it, but there wasn't a day when I didn't feel i was in over my head.
You should trust your instincts, agent ressler.
I do.
Tom keen came out of the woodwork.
Keen?
Does he know something?
No. He just wants to help.
And did you take it?
What, you kidding?
That guy's a liability.
Yes.
And a loose Cannon who'd shoot a guilty man in the back to prevent him from escaping.
But in a case like this, there can be a place for a man like that.
Are you telling me to trust my instincts?
My instincts were telling me to stay as far away from tom keen as possible.
You know what?
You're right.
You should trust your gut, not mine.
After all, look where my instincts got me.
You're a good agent, Donald.
You made the right call.
Red, yeah, hey, it's me.
We got a problem.
I think he's been taken.
The price of silence.
We're going to die in here.
In case you get tired of waiting.
What would you do to help her?
Anything.
I certainly don't like you.
You are a liar, a thief and a murderer, which is exactly why you're perfect for the job.
What job?
Previously on "The Last Man on Earth"...
Five weeks, solitary confinement it is.
Tandy saw the fire.
He got water from the pool until the fire was out.
Tandy did his time.
- How are things with you and Todd?
- He's just been kind of weird.
Daddy's home.
What a beautiful night.
Hey, I want to take the floor real quick.
Look, I know where I stand here, you know?
You guys let me out of the shed for good behavior, but I know I still have a ways to go before I'm fully back in this community.
Yeah, I-I just hope you guys give me a chance, 'cause I really care about you.
And I look forward to showing you that without a gun pointed in your face.
I know, I know.
Actions not words, but the actions are coming.
I have an action for you.
Give me a little wine.
Gail, thank you.
And one wine coming up.
Why are we sitting out here?
It's too cold!
I want to go back inside, Mommy!
Boom.
Still got it.
Crickets!
Crickets are alive!
Oh!
Oh, no way!
All right.
Presenting for the first time ever, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome... cricket casserole!
Is that what you were working on so long in the kitchen?
Yep.
It took longer than I thought, because I didn't realize how hard they are to kill.
I have to admit I felt a little intimidated...
Gail being a trained chef and all.
Did you ever make anything like this, Gail?
I did not.
Look, it might seem a little wonker-bonkers, but I was reading in Indian Vogue that crickets were all the rage over there.
They're full of protein and fiber.
They're also full of bug guts.
We're all full of guts.
But we're running out of options, aren't we?
All our canned goods have already expired.
There are no fish and no animals, except for the cow and she's not gonna live forever, so... like it or not, you're looking at our future.
Anyway, to the future.
Anybody else?
No?
It's okay.
Just wanted to do something nice for the group.
And I spent a lot of time on it.
No, Carol, we-we'll try it.
We'll try it, right?
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Go ahead, it's good.
This is re...
You certainly have a way with crickets.
Oh, get a room.
Hey, Todd, you haven't even touched yours.
I'm sorry, I'm-I'm just, I'm not feeling very well.
Well, that's too bad.
It really dances on your tongue.
This one's not dead.
Ah, now he is.
Here, cricket, cricket.
Don't you want to get turned into a disgusting meal by my wife?
Okay, let's see if this works.
Has anybody ever noticed you can get salmonella from chicken, but you can't get chicken-monella from salmon?
Boom.
Nothing?
Oh... my...
God.
Good morning.
I'm about to fry up some cricket poppers!
Who's in?
Thank you so much, Carol, but we found a couple of chowders that are only two years out of date, so I think we're gonna take our chances with that.
Yeah, Carol, I'm gonna pass, too. I'm not feeling very hungry.
I think I'm gonna pass as well, Care Bear.
Save me a plate, though.
Well, what do you want...
breast, wing, thigh, face?
Chef's choice.
Count me in, Carol.
And I'm okay with whatever you have.
God.
Erica, wait.
I cut my finger.
Geez, that's a gusher.
Carol, get some paper towels.
Sorry, I get nauseous on the sight on blood.
That's proof, oh!
Gail, you're our medical expert. What do we do here?
- Medical expert, hardly. - Well, you knew all that CPR mumbo jumbo.
Well, that doesn't mean I know anything about cuts.
Don't say cuts. Anything can set me off.
- You guys, it's fine. It's gonna be fine. - No.
No, you know what?
That looks really bad.
I-I'm gonna go get that first aid book.
Pretty cool house, huh?
Huh?
- How you doing, Todd?
- Good. How-how are you?
Light switch on... off.
On, off.
It works!
Probably 'cause the solar power, I guess.
Wonder what else could be working in here?
What else could be working?
Yeah, you know, I don't, I don't really know...
You hear that?
It's like a hum?
Where's that coming from?
I-I-I don't know, Tandy.
'Cause it sounds like it's coming from right over here.
What's in the freezer, Todd?
Nothing, really. It's just...
I already know, Todd.
It's the same thing that's in your stomach right now.
Bacon.
42 packages of bacon to be exact.
I counted them all yesterday when I caught you sneaking out of here.
How many were in there when you found it?
I'm guessing you're gonna say 42, but I'd be willing to bet that the number was just a little bit higher, now, wasn't it, Todd?
- Wasn't it?
! - Yes, Tandy!
There were more.
Now, I wonder... did you ask the group if they wanted some bacon?
Huh?
'Cause they're all eating bugs, man.
Bugs!
And you don't think they'd want to hear about this?
'Cause I think they would.
Maybe somebody should go tell them about it.
No!
Tandy, please God!
No!
Anything you want to say to me before I go down there and tell them?
Yes, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry, Tandy. I'm really, really sorry, man.
'Cause I have something I want to say to you.
Start cooking.
I don't need stitches.
I can see yellow fatty tissue.
Which means that that cut will not close on its own, which means you do need stitches.
Okay, well, which of you bozos is gonna do that?
I would like to take a strike at it.
Gail, are you drunk?
I have been drinking, but I am not drunk.
So, how are things going with you and Melissa?
Hey, don't, okay?
Don't bring her up.
Feeling kind of guilty?
No, Tandy, I feel great about it.
You know, I love hiding secrets from my lover.
I'm on top of the frigging world about it.
You know, I've been thinking a lot about the, the stuff that I did to you back in Tucson.
- And I just want to say I'm sorry... - Look, just shut up and eat, okay?
The only reason you're here is so you can't blackmail me.
Todd, I...
I would never blackmail you.
I mean, we're bros.
Tandy, we're not bros.
This is just about the bacon.
Just about the bacon.
Got it.
Hey, lady!
How's your hand?
Never mind.
Okay, so I need some help with my outfit.
Phil has been extra flirty with me, and I'm getting the sense that it's upsetting Erica.
Oh, you think?
I mean, I've only seen her give you like a hundred eye rolls.
Thank you. I know.
It's like, "Hi. Would you like some butter with your eye rolls?"
I know. It's like, "Don't fill up on eye rolls, Erica.
Save room for dinner."
We have fun.
But seriously, I'm not even trying to attract Phil.
I think I just need to tamp down my essence, find something a little more, I don't know, boring.
Oh, like what you have on.
I juiced up some crickets for you guys.
It tastes so good.
Just like chicken juice.
And there's one for everybody.
Milady.
My man.
Oh, thank you, Tandy. Just pass 'em on down.
And there's one for you, Phil.
You can just get it yourself.
Okay. Thank you.
Wow, this is fantastic.
You're right... it tastes just like cold chicken broth.
So good.
Thanks for the juice, Carol, but I'm... you know, I'm not... not feeling super hungry today.
Are you okay?
You haven't eaten in days.
Yeah, I'm fine. I just think I'm maybe coming down with something.
Oh, I can go to the pharmacy and get you...
I'm-I'm fine! You know?
I just think I'm coming down with something.
I'm gonna go for a walk.
You know, truth be told, I'm feeling the same way.
Think I might be coming down with whatever he has.
We compared symptoms earlier. It checks out.
Oh, Melissa, look at your finger.
Oh, God.
Girl, you're not bleeding out on my watch.
You need stitches, and I will not take "no" for an answer.
Okay, fine.
Okay. I'm gonna go get my gear.
Erica.
- We need to talk. - Do we, Carol?
You've been eye-rolling me like a googly doll since I got here.
You don't think I see all the flirting you've been doing with Phil?
If anything, I'm doing the opposite.
I mean, for Pete Sampras, look at this dumb outfit I borrowed from Melissa.
I don't know, you look fine to me.
This needs, like, a pineapple on it or a giraffe or children sliding down a rainbow.
I mean, this is not me.
But I'm wearing it.
And you know why?
'Cause I care about you.
Spare me, Carol.
Erica, we have a chance to do something different in this new society.
Wouldn't it be nice to not catfight anymore?
Every time a girl gets broken up with, she blames the other girl.
But why?
It's the guy's fault.
I mean, think about it.
What did I do?
Nothing.
So blame him.
No, him.
Let's do this thing.
Gail?
Come here.
- Breathe on me. - Why?
Because I've never heard a doctor yell "whoo" before a procedure.
Come here.
Gail.
Well...
I had one scotch, and it was like two hours ago, and I've barely been drinking since.
Say the alphabet backwards.
Z, Y, X, W, V, U, T, S, R, Q, P, O,
N, M, L, K, J, I, H, G, F, E, D, C, B, A.
May I go now, Officer?
I'm gonna need an anesthetic.
Got you covered.
Gail.
- Have at it. - Whoo!
Sorry.
Sorry. Sorry.
Okay, this is crazy.
Look, I know it's just about the bacon, but I'm concerned about you.
And I think I have a way to make you feel better.
Look, we still have three bacons left.
Why don't we bring it down to the group
- and share it with them?
- What?
I know it's just three bacons, but the others have no idea how many packages there were before we got into them.
So, to them,
- it'll feel like a million bacons. - No, Tandy. No way.
We clean this place up, we get rid of all the evidence, you take all the credit.
- You'll be a hero. - No, Tandy, I said no!
I'm in too deep, man.
So we just keep up this routine till the bacon is gone, and then we go our separate ways, and this never happened.
Fine.
Just about the bacon.
Voilà.
I'm so hammered, I see two fingers, but they're both perfectly stitched.
You could give our little seamstress Carol here a run for her money.
- Phil?
- Hey.
Why don't you take that comment, put it inside a bottle and shove it up your butt?
- What?
- And then take that bottle back out, put it inside a bigger bottle, and then shove that up your butt, too.
What's gotten into you?
I'm sick and tired of you hitting on Carol.
Can't you see it's making us both uncomfortable?
Ooh, you got served.
You got served. ♪ Taking the bacon and making it disappear... ♪ How do I get rid of this?
No.
Fire pit?
No.
Bingo.
What's going on?
- Todd, you know what's going on. - _
CAROL: Is that bacon? !
Where did you find this?
Well...
I'll tell you where he found it.
He found it at a house up the road.
It has solar panels, so the freezer's still working.
He told me about it yesterday, made me promise not to say anything 'cause he wanted to surprise you guys.
- Hey, nice work, bud. What a hero, huh?
- Ah, thanks.
Todd!
- Todd!
Todd!
Todd!
- Oh... no.
Todd!
Todd!
Todd!
Todd!
Todd!
- Oh, you're the bacon man! - No, you're the bacon man.
You're welcome.
I told you not to do this. Now they know about the bacon.
What if they find out about the rest?
It's all taken care of. All the evidence is gone.
If you've got a bacon-sniffing dog out there, it wouldn't even notice.
In fact, it'd probably take a nap 'cause it was so bored.
- What'd you do with the wrappers?
- Relax.
They're someplace nobody will ever find them.
Guys, come here. Check this out.
- What is that?
- Quick.
- Oh, my God. - What?
What?
- What is it?
- Right there.
Apparently there's something to see over here.
- Check it out.
- May I?
May I?
May I?
- Thank you. - You see it?
Hey, look at that!
Do you see it?
It's not good.
- Oh, my God. - It's coming so fast.
A Jet Ski!
Amazing.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
What is this?
What do we got here?
MELISSA: What is all this?
Bacon. Oh, my God.
Must've... must've come from Japan.
What a coincidence. We were just talking about this.
Todd, anything you want to tell us?
I'm so sorry, guys.
I found all this bacon, and I ate it.
Oh, Todd.
How could you do this?
I mean, how dare you?
Yeah, how dare you stand there... and take all the blame for what I did?
I found all this bacon, and I kept it to myself, and none of you would have ever known a thing.
But then Todd came in.
Perfect Todd... the nicest, trustworthiest, straight-shootinest, selflessest son of a gun I've ever known.
He immediately said,
"Hey, let's go share this with the community."
"Screw the friggin' community!" I said.
"Eat this with me, and we'll go down together."
Then he said, "That's wrong, sir.
Never!" So I pulled a gun on him... you guys know
I do that from time to time.
Then he took the gun, and he put it in his mouth and said, "Pull the trigger, 'cause I would rather be dead than not share this pork product with the people I love."
And as I cocked my gun, he calmly walked over, picked up the three remaining bacons, marched straight out the door and delivered them to you guys, tied up in a bow.
'Cause when Todd gives you bacon, he puts a bow on it.
But that's friggin' Todd.
Todd. Todd.
Todd. Todd. Todd.
Todd. Todd. Join in.
- Todd... - Okay, Todd, what's the real story?
This was me.
I found the bacon.
Tandy caught me eating it, he had a little bit, too, but... this was all me.
Surprise, surprise.
The fat guy ate the bacon.
And I'm so sorry.
I'll never be able to forgive myself because I lied to all of you, and I lied to the woman that I love.
And I'll take whatever punishment you guys think is fair.
I will.
Because I've been bad.
Nice try, Todd.
And it moves me that you tried to stick up for me like that, but, guys, it was me!
Can it, Tandy.
Guys, who you gonna believe?
Him or me?
Hey, Tandy.
Thanks, man.
You're welcome.
But look, I know it was just about the bacon, so...
No.
No, it wasn't.
Thanks, bud.
Fist bump?
Bump.
